  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The late Admiral Fitzroy entertained the opinion that the various
phenomena which go to form what we call “weather” are “measurable
at any place, and that having these measurements at <i>various</i> places over
a given area, such as the British Isles, we ought to be able to foresee
the peculiar results as regards the direction and force of air currents
which have their distinctive weather characteristics in relation to temperature,
rainfall, and electrical manifestations.”</p>

<p class='c003'>A conviction of the soundness of this opinion has induced the writer
to make the present compilation, in the hope that many who have
hitherto avoided the subject of meteorology and the weather may find
interesting matter, where before all seemed dull and technical.</p>

<p class='c003'>Any attempt at rigid mathematical accuracy is disclaimed at the outset;
the leading principles involved in weather forecasting and storm
prevision will, however, be stated in a sufficiently definite manner to
divest the subject of the mystery in which it has hitherto seemed to be
enshrined, and thus enable the unscientific reader to become weather-wise,
and casual observers to note weather phenomena with some degree
of method and precision.</p>

<p class='c003'>On page <a href='#Page_4'>4</a> will be found a list of works which have proved useful
aids in making the present compilation. The writer desires to
acknowledge his indebtedness to the various authors and publishers,
and especially to Mr. Strachan, for permission to quote from his able
pamphlet on “Weather Forecasts, and Storm Prevision,” and to reproduce
the valuable table on page <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>, for Calculating Heights of
Mountains, from the fourth edition of his handy “Pocket Meteorological
Register.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The publication of Weather Reports in the daily journals must have
convinced the most indifferent that much greater importance is now
attached to weather phenomena than formerly; and this conviction
will be deepened when it is remembered that a Parliamentary grant of
£10,000 is annually expended in support of the Meteorological Office
and its seven fully organized observatories in this country, while America
expends no less a sum than £80,000 annually in the pursuit of weather
wisdom; and the leading nations of Europe have also established
meteorological observatories in suitable localities.</p>

<p class='c003'>The balloon ascents of Messrs. Glaisher and Coxwell attracted much
attention to the instruments used in estimating atmospheric phenomena,
and awakened a desire to know something of the functions of a barometer,
thermometer, hygrometer, &amp;c., and especially of the classification
of those important weather-warners, clouds. These subjects
will be found duly noted in their order, and every phenomenon
being traced to its source, Solar Radiation, it is hoped that these pages
may prove generally acceptable, and be deemed not altogether unworthy
of</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>WEATHER WARNINGS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The two great Forces of Nature are Gravitation and
Heat, which always act in opposition to each other.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Weather</span> is the result of the action of these forces on
matter, and where one form of force is in excess of
another, changes are produced which become apparent
to our senses, or are indicated by suitable instruments.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>The Matter</span> composing the earth on which we live
is of three kinds—solid, liquid, and gaseous.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>The Force</span> incessantly acting on these is the radiant
heat of the sun.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>The Results</span> of this incessant action are:—</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <span class='sc'>Calorification</span>, or Heating, which, besides being
appreciable by our senses, is indicated by the
<span class='sc'>Thermometer</span>.</p>
<p class='c006'>2. <span class='sc'>Evaporation</span>, which alters the weight of the air
indirectly, by the diffusion of aqueous vapour
through it. This alteration of <i>weight</i> is
indicated by the <span class='sc'>Barometer</span>, the accompanying
increase of moisture being indicated
by the <span class='sc'>Hygrometer</span>.</p>
<p class='c006'>3. <span class='sc'>Rarefaction</span>, which alters the <i>weight</i> of the air
directly.</p>
<p class='c006'>4. <span class='sc'>Condensation</span>, producing fog, dew, rain, hail,
and snow; all sufficiently apparent when they
occur, but estimated accurately only by the
Rain Gauge, or <span class='sc'>Pluviometer</span>.</p>
<p class='c006'>5. <span class='sc'>Motion</span>, producing winds, which we are able to
appreciate in the gentle breeze and the awful
cyclone, the force and velocity of which are
indicated by the <span class='sc'>Anemometer</span>.</p>
<p class='c006'>6. <span class='sc'>Electrification</span>, producing lightning, thunder,
magnetic phenomena, and chemical change,
respectively indicated by the <span class='sc'>Electrometer</span>,
<span class='sc'>Magnetometer</span>, and <span class='sc'>Ozonometer</span>.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>I.—CALORIFICATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Before considering in detail these results of the action
of solar radiation on our globe, an attempt to realize
the immensity of this stupendous force will materially
aid in the general comprehension of the subject.</p>

<p class='c003'>The earth is a sphere somewhat less than 8,000 miles
in diameter; and if we assume, with the gifted author<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
of “The Phenomena of Radiation,”—“that it is about
91,300,000 miles from the sun, and moves around it in a
slightly elliptical orbit, occupying rather more than 365
days; that its shape is globular, somewhat flattened at its
two extremities; that it rotates upon its own axis in the
space of 24 hours, that axis being inclined to the annual
orbit at an angle of 23-1/2—if we further assume that
solar radiation is of such kind and quantity as it is, we
are enabled to account for the total amount of light and
heat the earth receives, for the superior temperature
and illumination of equatorial regions, as compared with
polar, with the gradations of intermediate zones, for
the alternation of day and night, and the annual progression
of the seasons.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The actuating force of every wind that blows; of
every mighty current that streams through ocean depths;
the motive cause of every particle of vapour in the air of
every mist and cloud and raindrop, is <span class='sc'>Solar Radiation</span>.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The delicate tremor of the sun’s surface particles,
shot hither through thirty million leagues of fine intangible
æther, has power to raise whole oceans from their
beds, and pour them down again upon the earth. We
are apt to measure solar heat merely by the sensation it
produces on our skin, and think it small and weak
accordingly; a good coal fire will heat us more. But
its true measure is the work it does. Judged by this
standard, its immensity is overpowering. To take a single
instance: the average fall of dew in England is about
five inches annually; for the evaporation of the vapour
necessary to produce this trifling depth of moisture,
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>there is expended <i>daily</i> an amount of heat equal to the
combustion of sixty-eight tons of coal for <i>every square
mile</i> of surface, or, for the whole of England, 4,000,000
tons. Compare now the size of England with that of
the whole earth—only 1/3388th part; extend the calculation
to <i>rain</i>, as well as dew, the average fall of which
on the whole earth is estimated at five feet annually, or
<i>twelve</i> times greater; and then estimate the sum of
4,000,000 × 3,388 × 12 = 162,624,000,000 tons, or about
3,000 times as much as is annually raised in the whole
world; and we have the number of tons of coal required
to produce the heat expended by the sun merely in raising
vapour from the sea to give us rain during a single day.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>SOLAR RADIATION.</h3>

<p class='c003'>Seeing, then, that solar radiation plays so important
a part in the production of the natural phenomena
classed under the head of Meteorology, a description
of the mode of estimating its amount will prove interesting,
and enable the reader to realize the existence
of this mighty power. M. Pouillet devised for this purpose
the apparatus known as the <span class='sc'>Pyrheliometer</span>,
which registers the power of
parallel solar rays by the amount of
heat imparted to a disc of a given
diameter in a given time. It consists
of a flat circular vessel of steel A having
its outside coated with lamp-black B.
A short steel tube is attached to the
side opposite to that covered with lamp-black,
and the vessel is filled with mercury.
A registering thermometer C, protected
by a brass tube D, is then attached,
and the whole is inverted and exposed
to the sun, as shown at Fig. 1. The
purpose of the second disc, E, is to aid
in so placing the apparatus that it shall
receive direct parallel rays. It is obvious
that if the shadow of the upper
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>disc completely covers the lower one, the sun’s rays
must be perpendicular to its blackened surface.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The surface on which the sun’s rays here fall is
known; the quantity of mercury within the cylinder is
also known; hence we can express the effect of the sun’s
heat upon a given area by stating that it is competent,
in five minutes, to raise so much mercury so many
degrees in temperature.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<hr class='c014' />
<p class='c003'>Sir John Herschel also designed an instrument
for observing the heating power of the sun’s
rays in a given time, to which the title Actinometer
is given. It consists of a Thermometer
with a long open scale and a large cylindrical
bulb, thus combining the best conditions for
extreme sensibility. An observation is made
by exposing the instrument in the shade for
one minute and noting the temperature. It is
then exposed to the sun’s rays for one minute,
and a record of the temperature made. It is
again placed in the shade for one minute, and
the mean of the two shade readings being
deducted from the solar reading shows the
heating power of the sun’s rays for one minute
of time.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>The stimulus imparted to the study of this
class of phenomena by the publications of Professor
Tyndall’s researches on Radiant Heat
has induced a demand among Meteorologists for
instruments capable of yielding more available
indications than those just described. This
demand has been most efficiently supplied by
the ingenuity of scientists and instrument
makers.</p>

<p>3.<br />Improved Solar Radiation Thermometer in Vacuo.<br />Scale about 1/3.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The early form of Solar Radiation Thermometer
was a self-registering maximum
thermometer, with blackened bulb, having its
graduated <i>stem</i>, only, enclosed in an outer tube.
Errors arising from terrestrial radiation and the
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span><i>variable</i> cooling influences of aërial currents are all
obviated in the improved and patented Solar Radiation
Thermometer shown at Fig. 3, which consists of a self-registering
maximum thermometer, having its <i>bulb
and stem</i> dull-blackened, in accordance with the suggestion
of the Rev. F. W. Stow, and the <i>whole</i> enclosed
in an outer chamber of glass, from which the air has
been completely exhausted. The perfection of the
vacuum in the enclosing chamber is proved by the
production of a pale white phosphorescent light, with
faint stratification and transverse bands when tested
by the spark from a Ruhmkorff coil. Due provision is
made for this by the attachment of platinum wires to
the lower side of the tube, and when tested by a syphon
pressure gauge, the vacua have been proved to exist
to within 1/50th of an inch of pressure. It will thus
be seen that the indications are preserved from errors
arising from atmospheric currents, and from the absorption
of heat by aqueous or other vapours, the
whole of the solar heat passing through the vacuum
direct to the blackened bulb. The contained mercury
expanding, carries the recording index to the highest
point, and thus is obtained a registration of the
maximum amount of solar radiation during the
twenty-four hours. The great advantage accruing
from the high degree of perfection to which this
instrument has been brought is, <i>uniformity</i> of construction,
which renders the observations made at
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>different stations <i>intercomparable</i>. An enlarged view of
the thermometer is given at Fig. 3, showing the platinum
wire terminations, whereby the vacuum is tested. The
Rev. Fenwick W. Stow thus directs the manner in which
the solar radiation thermometer should be used:—</p>

<p class='c003'>1. Place the instrument four
feet above the ground, in an
open space, Fig. 4, with its
bulb directed towards the S.E.
It is necessary that the globular
part of the external glass should
not be placed in contact with or
very near to any substance, but
that the air should circulate
round it freely. Thus placed, its
readings will be affected only
by direct sunshine and by the
temperature of the air.</p>

<p class='c003'>2. One of the most convenient
ways of fixing the instrument
will be to allow its stem to fit
into and rest upon two wooden
collars fastened across the ends
of a narrow slip of board, which
is nailed in its centre upon a post
steadied by lateral supports
(Fig. 4).</p>

<p class='c003'>3. The maximum temperature of the air in shade
should be taken by a thermometer placed on a stand
in an open situation. Any stand which thoroughly
screens it from the sun, and exposes it to a free circulation
of air, will do for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c003'>4. The difference between the maxima in sun and
shade, thus taken, is a measure of the amount of solar
radiation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The remarkable phenomenon recently discovered by
Mr. Crookes, in which light is apparently converted
into motion, has, at the suggestion of Mr. Strachan,
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>received an interesting application to meteorology. The
arrangement is shown at Fig. 5, where a Solar Radiation
Thermometer has a Crookes’ Radiometer attached
to it, which, in addition to forming an efficient test as
to the perfection of the vacuum, will, it is hoped, aid in
eventually establishing a relation between intensity of
radiation, as shown by the thermometer, and the number
of revolutions of the radiometer. The instrument
has so recently been devised that any positive statement
as to its usefulness would be premature; it may,
however, prove a valuable auxiliary to the solar thermometer,
and eventually be so far improved as to become
a more definite exponent of solar radiation than the
thermometer.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>TERRESTRIAL RADIATION.</h3>

<p class='c003'>It is an established fact, confirmed by careful experiments,
that a mutual interchange of heat is constantly
going on between all bodies freely exposed to view
of each other, thus tending to establish a state of
equilibrium. It has further been ascertained that, as
the mean temperature of the earth remains unchanged,
“it necessarily follows that it emits by radiation from
and through the surface of its atmosphere, on an average,
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>the exact amount of heat it receives from the sun.”
This process commences <i>slowly</i> at sunset, and proceeds
with great rapidity at and after midnight, attaining its
maximum effect in a long night, in perfect calm, under
a cloudless sky, resulting in the condensation of vapour
in the form of dew, or hoar-frost, when the temperature
of the surface-air is reduced to the dew-point.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c003'>The extent to which heat thus escapes by radiation
under varying conditions of sky is measured by a
Self-registering Terrestrial Minimum Thermometer, the
bulb of which
is placed over
short grass, and
“a thermometer
so exposed under
a clear sky
always marks
several degrees
below the temperature
of the
air, and its depression
affords
a rude measure of the facility for the escape of heat
afforded under the circumstances of exposure.” <a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Fig. 6 shows the ordinary spherical bulb thermometer
employed for this purpose, and Fig. 7 the improved
Cylinder Jacket Thermometer, which, by exposing a
larger surface of
spirit to the air,
gives an instrument
possessing an
amount of sensibility
in no way
inferior to that of
mercury.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is a drawback
to the use
of these thermometers
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>enclosed in outer tubes, arising from moisture
getting into the outer cylinder or jacket, and frequently
preventing the observer from reading the thermometer.
This has recently been removed by making a perfectly
ground joint of glass (analogous to a glass stopper in a
bottle) as a substitute for the old form of packing at the
open end of the tube, the other end being fused into contact
with the outer cylinder to keep it in its place. The
intrusion and condensation of moisture thus becomes
impossible, while the scale is protected from corrosion
or abrasion. This “ground socket” arrangement is
shown at Fig. 8.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>Radiation from the earth upwards proceeds with
great rapidity under a cloudless sky, but a passing
cloud, or the presence even of invisible aqueous vapour
in the air, is sufficient to effect a marked retardation, as
is beautifully illustrated by Sir John Leslie’s Æthrioscope,
shown at Fig. 9, which consists of a vertical glass
tube, having a bore so fine that a little coloured liquid is
supported in it by the mere force of cohesion. Each end
of the tube terminates in a glass bulb containing air. A
scale, having its zero in the middle, is attached to the
tube, and the bulb A is enclosed in a highly polished
sphere of brass. The upper bulb B is blackened, and
placed in the centre of a highly-gilt and polished metallic
cup, having a movable cover F. These outer metallic
coverings protect the bulbs from extraneous sources of
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>heat. So long as the upper bulb is
covered, the liquid in the tube stands
at zero on the scale, but immediately
on its removal radiation commences,
the air contained in B contracts, while
the elasticity of that contained in A
forces the liquid up the tube to a
height directly proportionate to the
rapidity of the radiation.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>SHADE TEMPERATURE.</h3>

<p class='c003'>Self-registering Maximum Thermometers
are made in two ways. In
the first, the index is a small portion
of the mercurial column separated
from it by a minute air bubble. The
noontide heat expands the mercury,
and the subsequent contraction as the temperature decreases
affects only that portion of the mercury in connection
with the bulb, leaving the disconnected portion
to register the maximum temperature. In the second
form the tube is ingeniously contracted just outside the
bulb, so that the mercury extruded from the bulb by
expansion cannot return by the mere force of cohesion,
but remains to register the highest temperature.</p>

<p>10.<br />Self-registering Maximum Thermometer. Scale about 1/5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>There is a modification of this latter form produced by
the addition of a supplementary chamber just outside
the bulb and <i>over</i> the column, from which, as expansion
proceeds, the mercury flows by gravitation, but into
which it cannot return until, as in the other forms,
the instrument is readjusted for a new observation, by
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>unhooking the bulb end and lowering it until the mercury
flows into its place.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Thermometer is “set” for observation by slightly
raising the bulb end until the index slides to the extreme
end of the column of spirit. It is then suspended in
the shade with the bulb end a little lower than the
other. The contraction of the spirit consequent on a
fall of temperature draws the index back, but a subsequent
expansion does not carry it forward, it remains
at the lowest point to which the spirit has contracted
to register the minimum temperature. A very useful
modification of this instrument is made for gardeners and
general horticultural purposes, in which the scale is of
cast zinc with raised figures, which being filed off flush
after the whole has been painted of a dark colour are
easily legible at a little distance.</p>

<p class='c003'>Six’s Self-registering Thermometer consists of a long
tubular bulb, united to a smaller tube more than
twice its length, and bent twice, like a syphon, so that
the larger tube is in the centre, while the smaller one
terminates at the top, on the right hand, in a pear-shaped
bulb, as shown in the cut (Fig. 14). This bulb, and the
tube in connection with it, are partly filled with spirit;
the long central bulb and its connecting tube are completely
filled, while the lower portion of the syphon is
filled with mercury. A steel index, prevented from
falling by a hair tied round it, to act as a spring, moves
in the spirit in each of the side tubes. The scale on
the left hand has the zero at the top, and that on the right
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>at the bottom. When setting the instrument,
the indices are brought into
contact with the mercury by passing
a small magnet down the outside of
each tube. Then, should a rise of
temperature take place, the spirit in
the central bulb expands, forcing
down the mercury in the left hand
tube and causing it to rise in the
right, and <i>vice versa</i> for a diminution
of temperature.</p>

<p class='c003'>It should be always used and carried
upright, and the indices should be
drawn <i>gently</i> down by the magnet into
contact with the mercury; and, when
a reading is taken, the ends of the indices
nearest the mercury indicate the
maximum and minimum temperatures
which have been attained during the
stated hours of observation.</p>

<p class='c003'>Evaporation and
the mechanical action of winds keep up
a constant circulating motion of the
ocean, the currents of which tend to
equalize temperature. The most important
of these is known as the Gulf
Stream, taking its name from the Gulf
of Mexico, out of which it flows at a
velocity sometimes of five miles an
hour, and in a width of not less than fifty
miles. It has an important effect
on the climate of Great Britain, and of
all lands subject to its influence, its
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>temperature as it leaves the Gulf of Mexico being 85°
F., diminishing to 75° off the coast of Labrador, and still
further as it nears northern latitudes. Observations on
the temperature of the ocean are therefore included
in the scope of meteorology, and are ascertained by the
use of thermometers of special construction (Fig. 15).
In the earlier experiments made for ascertaining
the temperature of the ocean at a depth of 15,000
feet, where the pressure is equal to three tons on
the square inch, it was found that a considerable error
occurred in the indications in consequence of this
enormous pressure; accordingly the
central elongated bulb of the ordinary
Six’s Thermometer (see page <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>) is
shortened and enclosed in an outer
bulb nearly filled with spirit, which,
while effectually relieving the thermometer
bulb from undue pressure,
allows any change to be at once transmitted
to it, and thus secures the registration
of the exact temperature. The
arrangement possesses the further advantage
of making the instrument
stronger, more compact, and more
capable of resisting such comparatively
rough treatment as it would receive on
board ship.</p>

<p class='c003'>The honour of constructing the first
thermometer, which was an Air and
Spirit Thermometer, is ascribed to
Galileo; it assumed a practical shape
in 1620, at the hands of Drebel, a
Dutch physician. Hailey substituted
mercury for spirit in 1697; Réaumur
improved the instrument in 1730, and
Fahrenheit in 1749. More recently
the instrument has been perfected by
the scales being graduated on the
actual stem of the instrument. For
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>many years it was exclusively used by chemists and
men of science; it afterwards received numerous applications
in the arts and manufactures; and is now
considered an essential in every household.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thermometers are instruments for measuring temperature
by the contraction or expansion of fluids in
enclosed tubes. The tubes, which are of glass, have
spherical, cylindrical, or spiral bulbs blown on to one
end; they have also an exceedingly fine bore, and when
mercury or spirit is enclosed in them these fluids, in
contracting and expanding with variations of temperature,
indicate degrees of heat in relation to two
fixed points—viz., the freezing and boiling points of
water. Care is taken to exclude all air before
sealing, so that the upper portion of the tube inside
shall be a perfect vacuum, and thus offer
no resistance to the free expansion of the
mercury. In graduating, or dividing the
scales, the points at which the mercury remains
stationary in melting ice and boiling
water are first marked on the stem, and
the intervening space divided into as many
equal parts as are necessary to constitute
the scales of Fahrenheit, Réaumur, or Celsius,
the last being known as the Centigrade (<i>hundred
steps</i>) scale, from the circumstance of
the space between the freezing and boiling
points of water being divided into one hundred
equal parts (Fig. 16).</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Graduation of Thermometers.</span>—When
the fluid (either mercury or spirit) has been
enclosed in the hermetically sealed tube, it
becomes necessary, in order that its indications
may be comparable with those of other
instruments, that a scale having at least two
fixed points should be attached to it. As it
has been found that the temperature of
melting ice or freezing water is always
constant, the height at which the fluid <i>rests</i>
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>in a mixture of ice and water has been
chosen as one point from which to graduate
the scale. It has been also found that with
the barometer at 29·905 the boiling-point of
water is also constant, and when a thermometer
is immersed in pure distilled water
heated to ebullition, the point at which the
mercury remains immovable is, like the
freezing-point, carefully marked, the tube is
then calibrated and divided as shown in
Fig. 16.</p>

<p class='c003'>The zero of the scales of Réaumur and
Centigrade is the freezing-point of water,
marked, in each case, 0°, while the intervening
space, up to the boiling-point of
water, is divided, in the former case, into
80 parts, and in the latter to 100°.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing-point
is represented at 32°, and the boiling-point
at 212°, the intervening space being divided
into 180°, which admits of extension above
and below the points named, a good thermometer
being available for temperature up to
620° Fahr.</p>

<p class='c003'>The use of the Réaumur scale is confined
almost exclusively to Russia and the
north of Germany, while the Centigrade
scale is used throughout the rest of Europe.
The Fahrenheit scale is confined to England
and her colonies, and to the United States
of America.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>II.—EVAPORATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Solar heat rarefies the air by driving its particles
asunder; it also vaporises water from the surface of
river, lake, and ocean, diffusing the vapour through the
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c003'>Great interest attaches to the subject of Evaporation,
on account of its connection with rainfall and water
supply. It is to be regretted, therefore, that the results
hitherto obtained in the endeavour to measure its rate
and quantity do not merit much confidence as regards
their applicability to the evaporation occurring in nature,
owing to the exceptional manner in which the observations
have been made.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is this uncertainty about evaporation, that all
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>the experiments relate to that taking place from an
exposed water surface of a, comparatively speaking, infinitesimally
small area, and can therefore have but a
very partial applicability to the conditions occurring
in nature. There are two main reasons for this
statement. Firstly, the proportion of the surface of the
land on the earth which is covered with lakes and rivers
is very limited, and the experiments above indicated
throw no light on the evaporation from the soil. Secondly,
the evaporation from the surface
of a small atmometer erected on
the ground, with comparatively dry
air all around it, is certainly very
different from that which would
take place from an equal area in
the centre of a large water surface,
such as a lake.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is of course easy to make experiments
on the evaporation from
the soil by means of a balance
atmometer, but in order that
these should possess a practical
value, the investigation must be
extended so as to include a wide
variety of soils, &amp;c., &amp;c. As regards
the second point which has
been raised, it is recommended by
the Vienna Congress to erect atmometers
in the centre of water
surfaces; but it is not a very easy
matter to conduct such experiments
with accuracy, owing to the
risk of in-splashing from waves.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Babington’s Atmidometer</span>
measures evaporation from water,
ice, or snow, and in form
resembles a hydrometer, with
the difference that the stem
bears a scale graduated to
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>grains and half grains, and is surmounted by a light,
shallow copper pan. When in use, the hydrometer-like
instrument is immersed in a glass vessel having
a hole in the cover, through which the stem protrudes.
The copper pan is then placed on the top, and
sufficient water, ice, or snow placed therein to sink
the stem to the zero of the scale. As the evaporation
proceeds, the stem rises; and, if the <i>time</i> of
commencing the experiment is noted, the rate as well
as the amount of evaporation is indicated in grains.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>III.—RAREFACTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The diffusion of aqueous vapour through the air and
the rarefying influence of heat jointly effect an alteration
in the weight of the atmosphere. This alteration of
<i>weight</i> is determined by the Barometer, an instrument
invented by <span class='sc'>Torricelli</span>, in 1643, and in so perfect a form
that in its essential features it has not been superseded.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id022'>

<div class='ic022'>
<p>21. and 22.<br />Construction of Barometer.<br />Scale about 1/18.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The mode of construction
is illustrated
by Figs. 21 and
22. It consists in
hermetically sealing
a glass tube about
three feet long and
filling it with mercury.
The finger is
placed over the open
end of the tube,
which is then inverted
and placed in a
cistern of mercury
and the finger withdrawn.
The left-hand
figure shows
the result; the mercury
is seen to fall
some three or four
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>inches, leaving an empty space at the top of the tube,
which is called the “Torricellian vacuum.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The mercury is prevented from falling lower than is
shown, by the external pressure of the atmosphere on
the cistern. The <i>weight</i> of this column, therefore,
represents the <i>weight</i> or pressure of a corresponding
column of air many miles in height; and so close is
the relation between the column of mercury and the
external air that the <i>height</i> of the former changes with
the slightest variation in the <i>weight</i> of the latter, and
the instrument thus becomes a measure of the weight of
the air, from which property its name is derived, the
Greek words <i>baros</i> and <i>metron</i> signifying respectively
“weight” and “measure.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When the mercury in the barometer tube
falls, that in the cistern rises in corresponding
proportion, and <i>vice versa</i>, so that there is an
ever-varying relation between the <i>level</i> of the
mercury in the tube and the mercury in the
cistern, which affects the accuracy of the
readings. In M. Fortin’s cistern this difficulty
is obviated by the use of a glass, with
flexible leather bottom and a brass adjusting
screw, as shown in the cut. Through the top
of the cistern is inserted a small ivory point,
the lower end of which corresponds with the
zero of the scale; and, to secure uniformity,
the level of the mercury in the cistern should
be adjusted by the screw at each observation,
until the ivory point <i>appears</i> to touch its own
reflection on the surface. The reading is
then taken.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In making barometric observations for comparison
with others, it is necessary that all should be reduced
to the common temperature of 32° F., and for this purpose
tables have been calculated which will be found to save
much time.</p>

<p class='c003'>Tables also for reducing observations of the barometer
to sea level, an operation equally indispensable with the
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>other corrections to make the
readings intercomparable, have
been published by direction of
the Meteorological Committee.</p>

<p class='c003'>For the British Isles the
mean sea-level at Liverpool
has been selected by the
Ordnance Survey as their
datum, and the height of any
station may be ascertained by
first noting the nearest Ordnance
Bench Mark thus <span class='xlarge'>↑</span>, and
purchasing that portion of the
Ordnance map which includes
the station, near to which the
Bench Mark will be found
with the height above sea-level
duly entered. The levellings
made for railways will
also furnish the desired information.
Failing both these, the observer should
select two or more of the stations nearest
his locality for which official Meteorological
Reports are published daily in the
<i>Times</i> and other journals; and taking
observations of his barometer at 8 a.m.,
for a few weeks, should compare them
with the mean of the observations at
those stations. The comparison should
be omitted when the barometer pressure
is not steady.</p>

<p>25. Standard Barometer. Scale about 1/7.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A Standard Barometer is constructed on
<span class='sc'>Fortin’s</span> principle, and should have its tube
about half an inch bore, enclosed in a brass
body having at its upper end two vertical
openings, in which the vernier works. The
mercury is seen through these openings,
aided by light reflected from a white opaque
glass reflector let into the mahogany board
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>behind. The scale is divided on one side into English inches
and 20ths, and may have on the other French millimetres,
the vernier enabling a reading to be taken, in each case respectively,
of 1/500th of an inch and 1/10th of a millimetre.
In making the instrument, the mercury is boiled in the
tube, to ensure the complete exclusion of air and moisture;
while <span class='sc'>Fortin’s</span> principle of cistern ensures a constant
level from whence to take the readings. A sensitive
thermometer with scale, engine-divided on stem, is attached
to the brass mount, which is perforated to admit
the attenuated bulb of the thermometer into absolute
contact with the glass tube of the barometer, to
ensure its indicating the same temperature as the contained
mercury. The instrument is suspended by a
ring from a brass bracket attached to a mahogany board,
and the lower end passes through a larger ring having
three screws for adjusting it vertically.</p>

<p class='c003'>A “reading” is taken in the following manner:—1.
Note the temperature by the attached thermometer.
2. Raise or lower the mercury in the cistern by
turning the screw underneath until the reflected
image of the ivory point on the mercury <i>seems</i> to be
in contact with the ivory itself. By the milled head at
the side, the vernier is adjusted until its lower
edge just touches the top of the mercurial column, the
scale and vernier then indicate the height of the
barometer in inches, 10ths, 100ths, and 1000ths.</p>

<p class='c003'>High-class instruments, such as that here described,
yield <i>exact</i> readings; but, in order to note them accurately,
it is important that the eye, the zero edge of
the vernier, the top of the mercurial column, and the
back of the vernier should be in the same horizontal
plane; conditions which may be obtained after some
practice.</p>

<p class='c003'>The accompanying illustration shows a form of
barometer which, though not much used in this
country, is deservedly popular on the Continent as a
standard station barometer. It is called a Syphon
Barometer, and was designed by Gay-Lussac. The
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>open end of the tube is bent up in the form of
a syphon, the short limb being from six to
eight inches long; it is furnished with metal
scales and verniers, and is mounted on a
mahogany board with attached thermometer.</p>

<p class='c003'>These barometers require no correction for
capillarity or capacity, each surface of
mercury being equally depressed by capillary
attraction, and the quantity of mercury
falling from the long limb occupies the same
space in the short limb. The usual correction
for temperature must, however, be
applied. A scale of inches, measured from a
zero point taken near the bend of the tube,
furnishes the means of measuring the long
and short columns. The difference of
readings is the height of the barometer.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <span class='sc'>Vernier</span> is a movable scale for subdividing
parts of a fixed scale, and was first
applied to that purpose by its inventor, <span class='sc'>M.
Pierre Vernier</span>, in 1630. In the barometer
the parts to be divided are inches, which by
the aid of this invention are subdivided into
10ths, 100ths, and 1000ths.</p>

<p class='c003'>Fig. 27 shows the scale of a standard
barometer divided into 1/2-10ths, or ·05 of an
inch. The Vernier C D is made equal to 24
of such divisions, and is divided into 25 equal
parts, from whence it follows that one
division on the scale is 1/25th of ·05 larger
than one on the vernier, so that it shows
a difference of ·002 of an inch. The vernier
reads ·0, or zero, upwards; D, therefore,
indicates the top of the mercurial
column.</p>

<p>26.<br />Syphon<br />Barometer.<br />Scale<br />about 1/12.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In Fig. 27, zero on the vernier is exactly
in line with 29 inches and 5/10ths of the fixed scale;
the reading, therefore, is 29·500 inches. The vernier
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>line <i>a</i> falls short of a division of the scale by ·002-inch;
<i>b</i>, by ·004; <i>c</i>,
by ·006; <i>d</i>, by ·008;
and the succeeding
line by ·010. If the
vernier be adjusted
to make <i>a</i> coincide
with <i>z</i> on the scale, it
will have moved
through ·002-inch;
and if 1 on the vernier
be moved to coincide
with <i>y</i> on the
scale, the space measured
will be ·010-inch.
Consequently,
the figures 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, on the vernier,
measure 100ths, and
the intermediate lines
even 1000ths of an
inch. In Fig. 28 the
zero of the vernier is
between 29·65 and
29·70 on the scale.
Glancing up the vernier and scale, the second line
above 3 will be found in a direct line with one on
the scale; this gives ·03 and ·004 to add to 29·65, so
that the actual reading is 29·684. In those instances
where no line on the vernier is found <i>precisely</i> to coincide
with a line on the scale, and doubt arises as to which to
select from two equally coincident lines, the rule is to
take the intermediate 1000th of an inch.</p>

<p>27. and 28.<br />The Vernier.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For household and marine barometers such minute
subdivisions of the scale are unnecessary, and the scales
of such instruments are therefore divided only to 10ths,
and the verniers made only to read to 100ths of an inch,
which is effected by making the vernier 9/10ths or
11/10ths of an inch long, and dividing it into 10 equal
parts.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>In “taking a reading” it is important
that it should be done as quickly as
possible, as the heat from the body and
the hand is sufficient to interfere with
that accuracy which is necessary where
the intention is to compare the readings
with those made by other observers.
This facility is soon acquired by a
little practice.</p>

<p>29. Farmer’s Barometer. Scale about 1/7.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Pediment Household Barometers,
though not so imposing in appearance
as the Wheel Barometer, yield direct
readings without the intervention of
the mechanical appliances necessary for
moving a needle over an extended dial.
Their mountings are for the most part
in oak, walnut, and other woods, the
scales are of ivory, porcelain, or
enamelled glass, and in their graduation
due regard is paid to the relative proportions
of cistern and tube, so that
the conditions essential to the production
of a Standard Barometer are
very closely attained. In common with
other barometers, it should hang in the
shade in a vertical position, so that light
may be seen through the tube. As a
purchaser would receive it in what is
called a “portable” state, it will be
necessary on first suspending it to take
the pinion key, fit it on the square-headed
pin at the bottom of the instrument,
and turn gently to the left till the
screw stops. The effect of this is to lower
the base of the cistern, and allow the
mercury in the tube to fall to its proper
level. The key should then be replaced
for use in moving the vernier. To make
this kind of Barometer portable for
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>travelling it should be unhung,
<i>very</i> gradually sloped
until the mercury is at the
top of the tube, when, the
instrument being upside
down, the base of the cistern
is screwed up by turning
the pinion key gently to the
right until it stops. Care
should be taken to avoid
concussion, and to have the
cistern end always uppermost,
or the instrument
lying flat.</p>

<p class='c003'>Fig. 29 shows a useful form
of barometer for the farmer,
combining as it does three
instruments in one, for the
thermometer on the right
hand of the scale having
its bulb covered with muslin
kept moist by communication
with a cistern of water
enables the two thermometers
to be employed as a
Hygrometer, the use of
which is described at page
<a href='#Page_50'>50</a>. This barometer should
be suspended in a place
where it will be exposed as
much as possible to the external
air, but not in sunshine.</p>

<p>30.<br />Wheel Barometer. Scale<br />about 1/6.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In Wheel Barometers the
varying height of a column
of mercury is shown by the
movement of a needle on a
divided circular dial, by
adopting the syphon form of
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>barometer tube, concealed behind the dial and frame.
An iron or glass float sustained by the mercury in the
open branch (Fig. 31) is suspended by a counterbalance
a <i>little</i> lighter than itself. The axis of the pulley has
the needle attached to it, and consequently moves the
needle with the rise and fall of the mercury. It is obvious,
therefore, that if the atmospheric pressure increases the
float falls and the needle turns to the right, and if it
diminishes the needle turns in the opposite direction.
The divisions on the scale represent inches, tenths, and
hundredths in the rise and fall of a column of mercury,
and these can be read with great
facility, as one inch occupies the
space of six or more on this very
open scale, according to size of
dial (Fig. 30). The wording is
arbitrary, and indicates the <i>probable</i>
weather that may be expected.</p>

<p class='c003'>Important improvements have
recently been effected in this form
of household barometers, so that
they may be recommended as
good weather indicators where facility
of reading is a desideratum.</p>

<p>31.<br />Mechanism of Wheel<br />Barometer.<br />Scale about 1/8.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Since the more scientific “Pediment”
has attained so high a
degree of popularity, a certain
amount of unmerited obloquy has
attached itself to the Dial or Wheel
Barometer invented by Dr. Hooke.
It must be conceded that the standard
form of pediment barometers
in which the height of the mercury
is seen at a glance is more strictly
an “instrument of precision,” but
it should not be forgotten, although
a delicate mechanism intervenes
between the mercury and the
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>observer, it is so arranged that a tenth of an inch rise
or fall causes a movement of the index over an inch
of space.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Aneroid Barometer indicates variations in atmospheric
pressure by the elevation and depression of
the sides of an elastic metallic box from which the air is
exhausted and which is kept from complete collapse by a
powerful spring. In
cases where <i>extreme</i>
accuracy is not indispensable,
the portability
and sensibility
of this instrument
recommend it for use
by tourists and fishermen.
It is “quick in
showing the variations
of atmospheric
pressure.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> “The
Aneroid readings may
be safely depended
upon.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> “Its movements
are always consistent.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> “Atmospheric
changes are
indicated <i>first</i> by the
Aneroid.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> It is
especially adapted for determining mountain altitudes,
some being furnished with a scale of feet, enabling the
observer to read off the height by direct observation,
and if adjusted once a year by comparison with a mercurial
standard is quite trustworthy. It is fully described
in a small pamphlet entitled “The Aneroid Barometer:
How to Buy, and How to Use it,” by a Fellow of the
Meteorological Society.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>By a suitable arrangement of clockwork, revolving a
cylinder bearing prepared paper, the aneroid barometer
forms an admirable self-recording instrument, showing
at a glance the height of the barometer: whether it is
falling or rising, for how long it has been doing so,
and at what rate the change is taking place, whether at
the rate of 1/10th per hour, or 1/10th in twenty-four
hours—facts which can only be obtained by very frequent
and regular observations from an ordinary barometer,
but which are nevertheless essential to
a reliable “weather forecast.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The height of mountains may also
be determined by the temperature at
which water boils, as this depends on
the pressure of the atmosphere, and
according to Deschanel, “just as we
can determine the boiling-point of
water when the external pressure is
given, so if the boiling-point be known
we can determine the external pressure,”
and as this varies with the elevation
above sea-level, the boiling-point
of water also varies.</p>

<p class='c003'>These facts induced Wollaston to
attempt the determination of heights of
mountains by an apparatus which he
called the Barometric Thermometer,
subsequently modified by Regnault and
called a Hypsometer, but now more
generally known as a Boiling-point
Thermometer.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>The illustration (Fig. 33) shows the instrument with
the telescopic tube drawn out for use, and the thermometer
surrounded by the vapour of boiling water. The
lamp is protected from wind by a perforated japanned
tin case covered with wire gauze. When the boiler
is charged and the lamp ignited the mercury ascends,
and the point at which it becomes stationary shows
the temperature, which will give the elevation in feet
above the sea-level on reference to the table supplied
by the optician from whom the instrument is purchased.</p>

<p>34.<br />Barograph. Scale about 1/6.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A highly-refined automatic arrangement is adopted
at some observatories called a Barograph, which, by the
aid of photography, becomes a self-recording mercurial
barometer. It is simpler in its arrangement than the
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>thermograph, and includes a clock of superior construction,
causing a cylinder bearing photographic paper to
make one complete revolution in forty-eight hours. A
double combination of achromatic lenses brings to a focus
rays passing through a slit placed in front of the mercurial
column, behind which is a strong gaslight or paraffin
lamp, the rays of which are condensed upon the slit by
a combination of two plano-convex lenses.</p>

<p class='c003'>Although a barometer is an instrument <i>artificially</i>
constructed by man, it should not be forgotten that when
once made the column of mercury is placed in a passive
or quiescent state in direct relation with the great forces
of nature, so that its indications become to some extent
<i>natural</i> phenomena. This is aptly illustrated by what
is called the “daily fluctuation” of the barometer which
occurs in all countries, though the hours and extent vary
with the latitude, diminishing as the latitude increases,
according to a definite law. The phenomena does not
admit of a satisfactory explanation, but is doubtless
connected with the daily variations of temperature and
of vapour in the air. The mercury falls <i>naturally</i> (so
to speak) from nine or ten to between three and four
p.m.; it then rises till between nine and ten p.m.
It falls again about four a.m., and rises again about
ten a.m. It is usually highest at nine a.m. and nine
p.m., and lowest at three a.m. and three p.m.</p>

<p class='c003'>These natural elevations and depressions of the mercury
should be allowed for in reading the barometer,
as any rise or fall in opposition to the natural rise
and fall possesses for that reason increased importance.
For instance, fine weather may be expected if the
mercury rises between nine a.m. and three p.m.; in like
manner rain may be expected should a fall take place
between three p.m. and nine p.m.</p>

<p class='c003'>It will be inferred from the preceding facts that there
are certain hours better suited for “taking a reading”
than others. When one observation only is made daily,
noon is the best time, two observations should be made
at nine a.m. and nine p.m., and for three the best hours
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>are nine a.m. (maximum), noon (mean), and three p.m.
(minimum).</p>

<p class='c003'>The opinion generally entertained that a high barometer
is an indication of fine weather, and a low one a
warning of bad weather, is open to exception, and an
increased value would attach to the indications of the
instrument in proportion as the following points are
noted and allowed for:—</p>

<p class='c003'>1. The actual height of the mercury. 2. Whether it
is rising or falling. 3. The rate of rise and fall. 4.
Whether the rise or fall has been long continued.</p>

<p class='c003'>The state of the barometer foretells <i>coming</i> weather,
and when the present weather disagrees with the barometer
a change will soon take place. A fall of half a
tenth, or more, in an hour is a sure warning of a storm,
a rapid rise is a warning of unsettled weather.</p>

<p class='c003'>The barometer is generally lowest with wind from the
S.W., and highest with wind N.E., or with a calm.
N.E. and S.W. may be called the wind’s poles, and the
difference of height due to <i>direction</i> only from one of
these bearings to another amounts to about half an
inch.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Storm Glass (Fig. 36) is a glass bottle, ten inches long,
containing a mixture of camphor, nitre, sal-ammoniac,
alcohol, and water. As “temperature affects the mixture
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>much,” an arrangement has recently been designed in
which the stem of a thermometer is immersed in the
fluid, as shown at Fig. 37, thus imparting a higher value
to its indications. The late Admiral Fitzroy says—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Since 1825, we have generally had some of these glasses, as
curiosities rather than otherwise; for nothing certain could be made
of their variations until lately, when it was fairly demonstrated that if
fixed undisturbed in free air, not exposed to radiation, fire, or sun, but
in the ordinary light of a well-ventilated room, or, <i>preferably</i>, in the
outer air, the chemical mixture in a so-called storm glass varies in
character with the <i>direction</i> of the wind—not its force.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The quarter from which the wind or storm is blowing is indicated by
the substance adhering more closely to the bottom of the glass <i>opposite</i>
to the point whence the wind or tempest arises.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Sympiesometer is an instrument used chiefly at
sea for purposes of comparison with the mercurial and
aneroid barometers. Its indications result partly from
the pressure and partly from the temperature of the
atmosphere; it would, therefore, be more correctly named
a Thermo-Barometer.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>The <i>height</i> of the atmosphere has been variously
estimated:—By Bravais, from the duration of twilight,
at 66 to nearly 100 miles; by Dalton, in 1819, from
observations of the auroral light, at 102 miles; by Sir
John Herschel, from similar observations in 1861, at 83
miles; from observations of meteors, from 100 to 200
miles; by Liais, in 1859, from observations on the
polarisation of the sky, at no less than 212 miles.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <i>density</i> of the atmosphere diminishes with distance
from the earth’s surface, in accordance with the
following rule:—“At a height of seven miles the density
of the atmosphere is reduced to one-fourth the density
at the sea-level, and for every additional seven miles,
the rarity of the air is similarly quadrupled.”</p>

<h3 class='c015'>NOTE ON THE VERIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS AT THE<br />KEW OBSERVATORY.</h3>

<p class='c003'>The Kew Committee of the Royal Society receive, for
verification and comparison with the standard instruments
of the Kew Observatory, barometers, thermometers,
and other instruments intended for meteorological
observation or scientific investigations.</p>

<p class='c003'>Any persons ordering instruments of opticians may
direct them to be previously forwarded to the observatory
for verification.</p>

<p class='c003'>A scale of charges is issued by the Committee which
is exclusive of packing and carriage, or of rail expenses,
when a special messenger is sent out. The Meteorological
Office, Victoria Street, London, also receives and
forwards instruments for verification to the Kew
Observatory.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Committee wish it to be understood that they
cannot undertake the verification of an inferior class of
instruments (such as barometers mounted upon wooden
frames, and thermometers not graduated on the stem),
and that the superintendent of the observatory may at
his discretion decline to receive such instruments as he
may consider unfit for scientific observation.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>IV.—CONDENSATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Dew is a deposition of moisture from the air, resulting
from the condensation of the aqueous vapour of the
atmosphere on substances which have become cooled by
the radiation of their heat. This is, in fact, the substance
of Dr. Wells’s famous Theory of Dew, enunciated
in 1814, and which, according to Dr. Tyndall, “has stood
the test of all subsequent criticism, and is now universally
accepted,” and by which all the phenomena of
dew may be explained.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dr. Wells’s experiments were interesting and conclusive.
He exposed definite weights (10 grains) of wool to
the air on clear nights, one <i>on</i> a four-legged stool, the
other <i>under</i> it, the upper portion gained 14 grains in
weight, the lower only 4 grains. On an evening when
one portion of wool, protected by a curved pasteboard
roof, gained only 2 grains, a similar portion on the top
of the miniature roof gained 16 grains. A little reflection
will suggest the explanation: radiation from the
wool was arrested by the pasteboard cover, while the portion
fully exposed to the sky lost all its heat, and thus
condensation ensued. Dr. Wells speaks with such candour,
and so pointedly, on this fact and its consequences, that
his words may be advantageously quoted: “I had often,
in the pride of half-knowledge, smiled at the means
frequently employed by gardeners to protect tender
plants from cold, as it appeared to me impossible that a
thin mat, or any such flimsy substance, could prevent
them from attaining the temperature of the atmosphere,
by which alone I thought them liable to be injured.
But when I had learned that bodies on the surface of
the earth become during a still and serene night colder
than the atmosphere, by radiating their heat to the
heavens, I perceived immediately a just reason for the
practice I had before deemed useless.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Familiar instances of the formation of dew will have
been noted by many “watchers;” <i>e. g.</i>, breathing on a
cold pane of glass, a tumbler of cold water becoming
dew-covered on being brought into a warm room, the
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>outside of a tankard of iced claret cup, &amp;c. When,
radiation is so free and rapid that the temperature is
below the freezing point, the dew freezes as it forms,
producing <i>hoar-frost</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>In our climate the air is never completely dry, nor
completely saturated with moisture, and the amount of
aqueous vapour held in suspension is very variable.
This fact has important bearings on many branches of
industry, as also on the hygienic qualities of the atmosphere.
The consideration that a certain amount of
moisture in the air is necessary to the continuance of
health will suggest the importance of maintaining that
due proportion in the atmosphere of sick rooms, where
the artificial heat so injudiciously used, often disturbs
the healthful hygrometric condition of the air. Mr.
<span class='sc'>Glaisher</span> is of opinion that the medical profession
should enforce, as far as lies in their power, the use of
this simple and effective instrument, which gives indications
so important to the comfort of the patient.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <i>amount</i> of moisture in the air is <i>estimated</i> by the
use of instruments called Hygrometers, which may be
thus classified:—</p>

<p class='c003'>1. Hygrometers of Absorption.—Made with hair,
oatbeard, catgut, seaweed, grass, chloride of calcium.</p>

<p class='c003'>2. Hygrometers of Condensation.—Regnault’s,
Daniell’s, Leslie’s, Dyne’s.</p>

<p class='c003'>3. Hygrometers of Evaporation.—Mason’s
Psychrometer, or Wet and
Dry Bulb Thermometers.</p>

<p class='c003'>By an ingenious application of
the affinity of the oatbeard for moisture,
Damp Detectors are constructed
for tourists, commercial travellers,
&amp;c., to test moisture and avoid the
consequences of sleeping in damp
beds. They are strongly gilt, and
resemble in size and shape a lady’s
watch.</p>

<div class='ic035'>
<p>38.<br />Damp Detector.<br />Scale about 2/3.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In Saussaure’s Hygrometer the
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>frame is of brass, and the scale of the same metal silvered.
It has an attached thermometer, and the indications are
the result of the contraction and expansion of a prepared
human hair, consequent upon its absorbing or
yielding moisture. The scale is divided on the arc of
a circle, and an index
needle, working on an enlarged
arc, multiples the
indications.</p>

<p class='c003'>Regnault’s Hygrometer
(Fig. 39) consists
of a thin and highly
polished silver tube or
bottle, into the neck of
which is inserted a delicate
thermometer. The
bottle has a lateral tubular
opening, to which is
attached a flexible tube
with an ivory mouthpiece.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ether is poured into the
silver tube in sufficient
quantity to cover the bulb
of the thermometer. The
ether is then agitated by
breathing through the
flexible tube until, by the
rapid evaporation thus
produced, a condensation
of moisture takes place,
readily observable on the
bright polished silver surface, and the temperature
indicated by the thermometer at that moment is the
dew-point.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Daniell’s Hygrometer, or Dew-point Thermometer
(Fig. 40), consists of a glass tube, bent twice at right
angles, each extremity terminating in a bulb about
1-1/2 inch in diameter, supported on a brass stand, to
which a thermometer is attached to indicate the temperature
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>of the surrounding air. The
lower bulb is of blackened glass,
to facilitate the observation of
the dew-point; it is about three
parts filled with pure ether, and
contains a very delicate thermometer.
The upper bulb at the
extremity of the short stem is
transparent, but covered with
thin muslin, upon which, when
an observation is made, pure
ether is slowly dropped. The
evaporation rapidly lowers the
temperature, until a moment
arrives at which dew condenses
on the black bulb. A quick eye is
necessary to note <i>this</i> and the temperature
shown by the thermometer
<i>simultaneously</i>, the latter showing the
degree at which the atmosphere is
saturated with moisture <i>at the time of
observation</i>. To avoid error, it is usual
to note the temperature at which the
dew disappears, and take the mean of
the two temperatures.</p>

the dew-point by direct observation,
by means of iced water and black
glass, enables the observer to dispense
with the use of ether, and shows the
dew-point with great distinctness.</p>

<p class='c003'>The total quantity of aqueous vapour which at any
temperature can be diffused in the air being represented
by 100, the percentage of vapour actually present will
be found in the table <i>opposite</i> the temperature of the dry
thermometer, and <i>under</i> the difference between the
dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. The degree of
humidity for intermediate temperatures and differences
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>to those given in the table
can be easily estimated.
Thus dry bulb 51°, wet
bulb 46°, give 69 for the
degree of humidity.</p>

<p class='c003'>The instrument, as
shown at page <a href='#Page_48'>48</a>, consists

of the thermometers has
some thin muslin tied over
it, and is kept moist by the
capillary action of a thread
dipping into a cistern of
water placed underneath.
It will be obvious that the
amount of evaporation
will be in proportion to the
dryness of the air, and that the differences of temperature
indicated by the two thermometers will be greatest when
the atmosphere is dry, and least when the air is damp.</p>

Thermometer Screens are employed. Illustrations

<h3 class='c018'>CLOUDS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The important office performed by clouds in the
economy of nature entitles them to extended consideration.
A cloud may be defined as “water-dust,” since
aqueous vapour diffused through the air is invisible
until the temperature is sufficiently lowered to produce
condensation; no satisfactory explanation, however,
has yet been given of the mode of suspension of this
water-dust, nor why it remains suspended in opposition
to gravitation. It is tolerably certain that electricity
is not without its influence, though the apparently
<i>stationary</i> character of some clouds is deceptive, for
while there may be no apparent motion in the mass
the particles constituting the mass are undergoing continuous
renewal, which justifies the assertion of Espy
that every cloud is either a forming or dissolving cloud.
Aeronauts in ascending from the earth pass through
many successive alternations of cloud-strata and clear
air which owe their existence to the varying temperature
and degrees of humidity of the atmospheric
currents so superposed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Luke Howard in his Askesian Lectures, 1802, divides
clouds into three primary modifications: cumulus,
stratus, and cirrus, with intermediate forms resulting
from combinations of the primaries, viz., cirro-cumulus,
cirro-stratus, cumulo-stratus, and cumulo-cirro-stratus
or nimbus. This nomenclature is now universally
adopted.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id041'>
<img src='images/illustration_044.jpg' alt='' class='ig041' />
<div class='ic041'>
<p>44.<br />Cirrus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Cirrus</span>, or mare’s tail cloud, appears as parallel,
flexuous, or diverging streaks or fibres, partly straight.
It is the lightest and the highest of all clouds, being
seldom less than three miles, and often ten miles, above
the earth, and shows the greatest variety of form.
On account of its great height it is assumed to consist
of minute snowflakes or crystals of ice, the refractions
and reflections from which produce the halos, coronæ,
and mock suns and moons which occur chiefly in this
cloud and its derivatives. It retains its varied outlines
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>longer than any other cloud; at sunrise it is the first to
welcome the sun’s rays, and at sunset the last to part
with them. It is the most useful of all clouds for
weather warnings.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Serene, settled weather may be expected</i> when
groups and threads of cirri are seen during a
gentle wind after severe weather.</p>
<p class='c006'>2. <i>A change to wet may be expected</i> when, after
continued fair weather, filaments, or bands of
cirri (<i>apparently</i> stationary), with converging
ends, travel across the sky.</p>
<p class='c006'>3. <i>Rain or snow, and windy, variable weather may
be expected</i> when cirri with fine tails vary
much in a few hours.</p>
<p class='c006'>4. <i>Continued wet weather may be undoubtedly
expected</i> when horizontal sheets of cirri fall
quickly and pass into the cirro-stratus.</p>
<p class='c006'>5. <i>A storm of wind and rain may be expected within
forty-eight hours</i> when fine threads of cirri
seem brushed backward from the south-west.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id042'>
<img src='images/illustration_045.jpg' alt='' class='ig042' />
<div class='ic042'>
<p>45.<br />Cumulus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Cumulus.</span>—This modification of cloud is most frequently
seen on bright summer days, and is appropriately
called “the day cloud” and “the summer
cloud.” It is formed only in the daytime, in summer
calms, and results from the rise of vapours from rivers,
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>lakes, and marshes into the colder regions of the air,
the lower portions of which are readily saturable. They
are characterized by a horizontal base, from which
they rise in dense conical and hemispherical masses
rivalling mountains in their magnitude.</p>

<p class='c003'>Their formation is due to the convection of heat from
the earth’s surface, which renders the lower atmospheric
strata capable of holding a larger amount of aqueous
vapour and simultaneously establishes an upward
current, which reaching the colder regions of the air
brings about the condensation of the aqueous vapour
into the elegant and ever-beautiful forms admired alike
“by saint, by savage, and by sage.” These begin as
mere specks, which enlarge until the sky is nearly
covered in the afternoon, and towards sunset they
generally disappear, their tops becoming cirri when the
air is dry.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Fine, calm, warm weather may be expected</i> when

<p>46.<br />Stratus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Stratus.</span>—As its name implies, this is a horizontal
sheet of cloud formed near the earth at night (whence
it has been called “the night cloud”) by the condensation
of moist air from rivers, lakes, and marshes, or
damp ground which has lost its day-heat by radiation,
especially in calm clear evenings, after warm days. It
appears as a white mist near, and sometimes touching,
the earth. It attains its maximum density about midnight,
but is dissipated by the rays of the morning sun.
Its formation, watched from a height over a large city,
is highly interesting, and is attributed by Sir John
Herschel to the soot suspended over such localities, each
particle of which acts as “an insulated radiant, collects
dew on itself, and sinks down rapidly as a heavy body.”
Still more interesting is it to observe from a similar
elevation the dissipation of this cloud when the sun has
attained such an altitude that its rays fall on the upper
surface of the stratus cloud, which then heaves like the
billows of the ocean, while the whole mass seems to
rise spontaneously from the earth, and speedily vanishes
“into air, into thin air.”</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>The finest and most serene weather may be expected</i>
when stratus clouds present the appearances
just described.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span><span class='sc'>Cirro-cumulus</span>, or “mackerel sky,” is a well-known
form of cloud occurring in small roundish masses, looking
like flocks of sheep at rest, and often at great
heights. It is seldom seen in winter.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Increased heat may be expected</i> when cirro-cumuli
appear.</p>
<p class='c006'>2. <i>A storm or thunder may be expected</i> when cirro-cumuli
occur mingled with cumulo-stratus in
very dense, round, and close masses.</p>
<p class='c006'>3. <i>Warm wet weather, and a thaw, may be expected</i>
when cirro-cumuli occur in winter.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Cirro-stratus</span> “appears to result from the subsidence
of the fibres of cirrus to a horizontal position, at the
same time approaching laterally. The form and relative
position when seen in the distance frequently give the
idea of shoals of fish.” It is called “the vane cloud”
and “mackerel-backed sky.”</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Rain, snow, and storm may be expected</i> when
<i>cirro-stratus</i> is seen alone or mingled with
cirro-cumulus, especially if the cirro-cumulus

mixture of cirro-stratus and cirro-cumulus
the former disappears, leaving the latter in

waved cirro-stratus.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Cumulo-stratus.</span>—This form of cloud results from
the mingling of the cumulus and cirro-stratus; it
appears sometimes as a thick bank of cloud with overhanging
masses. The cloud known as “<i>distinct</i>” cumulo-stratus
appears as a cumulus surrounded by small
fleecy clouds.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Thunder may be expected</i> when “distinct”

<p>47.<br />Nimbus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Nimbus, or cumulo-cirro-stratus.</span>—The name of
this cloud at once suggests that it is produced by a
combination of the three primary forms of cloud. The
<i>nimbus</i> is popularly known as “the rain cloud.” It is
really a system of clouds, having its origin chiefly in
the tendency of the <i>cumulo-stratus</i> to spread, overcast
the sky, and settle down to a dense horizontal black or
grey sheet, above which spreads the <i>cirrus</i>, and from
below which rain begins to fall.</p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>A cessation of rain may be expected</i> when the
grey lower portion of <i>nimbus</i> begins to break up.</p>
<p class='c006'>2. <i>A thunderstorm may be expected</i> when the <i>nimbus</i>
character of the cloud is very perfect.</p>
<p class='c006'>3. <i>Very copious showers may be expected</i> when the
<i>cirri</i> projected from the top of the rain-cloud
are very numerous.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Amount of Clouds.</span>—Any record of the proportion
of sky covered by cloud should be made on a scale of
0 to 10. A clear sky is registered 0, and a sky wholly
obscured as 10, any intermediate condition being represented
by 5—7, or other figures deemed appropriate by
the observer. The <i>kind</i> of cloud should be noted, as also
the direction in which it is driven by the wind, whether in
the upper or lower strata of the air. This operation may
be assisted by an ingenious arrangement, exhibited by
Mr. Goddard in 1862, and called a “cloud reflector,”
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>obtainable at any optician’s. Observations at the Greenwich
Observatory establish the facts that the least
amount of cloud exists during the night, especially in
May and June, and the greatest amount at midday,
and in winter; also that from November to February
three-fourths of the heavens are obscured by sun-repelling
clouds.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Height of Clouds.</span>—Great diversity of opinion
exists on this point. It is asserted, on the one hand,
that the region of clouds does not extend beyond five
miles above sea-level, but Glaisher has attained a height
of 36,960 feet, and from thence saw clouds floating at a
great height above him; and it is considered probable
that cirri are often ten miles above the earth.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Velocity of Clouds.</span>—This is of two kinds: 1st.
Velocity of Propagation; and 2nd. Velocity of Motion.
The first occurs when at a given altitude the dew-point
is suddenly attained, when the sky on one occasion
was covered from the eastern to the western horizon at
the rate of 300 miles per hour. The second is dependent
on the force of atmospheric currents, which is
much greater in the upper regions of the air than in
those nearer the earth. Accurate observations of the
shadows of clouds, borne across the fields on a summer’s
day, warrant the assertion that an apparently
slow motion of clouds is equal to eighty miles an
hour, while a velocity of 120 miles is attained without
impressing the observer with the idea of rapidity.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>The following “Weather Warnings” may be gathered
from the <span class='sc'>Colour of the Sky</span>:—</p>

<p class='c003'>Whether clear or cloudy, a rosy sky at sunset presages
fine weather; a sickly greenish hue, wind and
rain; a red sky in the morning, bad weather, or much
wind or rain; a grey sky in the morning, fine weather;
a high dawn (<i>i. e.</i>, when the first indications of daylight
are seen above a bank of clouds), wind; a low dawn
(<i>i. e.</i>, when the day breaks on or near the horizon), fair
weather. Light, delicate, quiet tints or colours, with
soft, indefinite forms of clouds, indicate and accompany
fine weather; but gaudy or unusual hues, with hard,
definitely outlined clouds, foretell rain and probably
strong wind. Also a bright yellow sky at sunset
presages wind; a pale yellow, wet; orange or copper-coloured,
wind and rain: and thus, by the prevalence
of red, yellow, green, grey, or other tints, the coming
weather may be told very nearly; indeed, if aided by
instruments, almost exactly.</p>

<p class='c003'>After fine, clear weather the first signs in a sky of
a coming change are usually light streaks, curls, wisps,
or mottled patches of white distant cloud, which increase
and are followed by an overcasting of murky vapour that
grows into cloudiness. This appearance, more or less oily or
watery as wind or rain will prevail, is an infallible sign.</p>

<p class='c003'>Usually, the higher and more distant such clouds
seem to be, the more gradual, but general, the coming
change of weather will prove.</p>

<p class='c003'>Misty clouds, forming or hanging on heights, show wind
and rain coming, if they remain, increase, or descend; if they
rise or disperse, the weather will improve or become fine.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>RAIN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The atmosphere at a given temperature is capable
of retaining only a given quantity of aqueous vapour,
invisibly diffused through it, at which temperature it is
said to be <i>saturated</i>. Should the temperature from any
cause be lowered, the aqueous vapour at once becomes
visible in the form of either cloud, dew, rain, snow, or
hail. It has already been shown that, although marshes
and rivers, inland seas and lakes, yield by evaporation
watery vapours to the air, the ocean is the great source
of rain, whence it is lifted in vast quantities by the
sun’s radiant heat, to be subsequently condensed by
passing into cooler regions, or by contact with cold
mountain peaks, falling to earth as a fertilizing shower
or a devastating flood.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sir John Herschel accounts for the formation of raindrops
by saying:—“In whatever part of a cloud the
original ascensional movement of the vapour ceases, the
elementary globules of which it consists being abandoned
to the action of gravity, begin to fall. The larger
globules fall fastest, and if (as must happen) they overtake
the slower ones, they incorporate, and the diameter
being thereby increased, the descent grows more rapid,
and the encounters more frequent, till at length the globule
emerges from the lower surface of the cloud at the
‘vapour plane’ as a drop of rain, the size of the drops
depending on the thickness of the cloud stratum and
its density.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Rain is very unequally distributed, there being portions
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>of the torrid zone where it <i>never</i> falls, one locality
in Norway where it falls three days out of four, and
another on the western side of Patagonia, at the base of
the Andes, where it falls every day. The quantities recorded
as having fallen at one time in some localities are
simply appalling. A fall of one inch is considered a very
heavy rain in Great Britain, and this fact will enable
the reader partially to realize the following stupendous
recorded falls:—Loch Awe, Scotland, 7 inches in 30
hours; Joyeuse, France, 31 inches in 22 hours; Gibraltar,
33 inches in 26 hours; hills above Bombay, 24
inches in one night; and on the Khasia Hills, where the
annual rainfall is 600 inches, 30 inches have been known
to fall on each of five successive days. Mr. G. J. Symons,
the able editor of the “Meteorological Magazine,” and indefatigable
superintendent of 2,000 Rain Gauges throughout
the United Kingdom, has compiled a table, showing
the equivalents of rain in inches, its weight per acre,
and bulk in gallons, the following portion of which,
while very useful to the farmer, will enable the curious
reader to make some interesting calculations, based on
the figures quoted above:—</p>

<p class='c003'>The instruments called Rain Gauges or Pluviometers
are, as their name implies, constructed to measure the
amount of rain falling in any given locality, and those
in most general use have this principle in common: that
the graduated glass always bears a definite relation to the
area of the receiving surface. A very extraordinary and
hitherto unexplained fact in connection with the fall of
rain, and which justifies the opinion that its formation is
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>not limited to the region of visible cloud, is that a series
of rain gauges placed at different elevations above the
soil are found to collect very different quantities of rain,
the amount being <i>greater</i> at the <i>lower</i> level. Thus, twelve
months’ observations by Dr. Heberden determined that
the amount of rain on the top of Westminster Abbey was
only twelve inches, that on a house close by but much
lower eighteen inches, and on the ground during the same
interval of time twenty-two inches. Accordingly, ten
inches is the height at which meteorologists have agreed
the edge of the rain gauge should be placed from the
ground. The spot chosen should be perfectly level, and
at least as far distant from any building or tree as the
building or tree is high, and, if the gauge cannot be
equally exposed to all points, a south-west aspect is
preferable. It is also important that the rain gauge
should be well supported, in order
to avoid its being blown over by
the wind; and, should frost follow
a fall of rain, the instrument
should be conveyed to a warm
room to thaw before measuring the
collected contents. The graduated
glass furnished with each instrument
should stand quite level
when measuring the rain, and the
reading be taken midway between
the two apparent surfaces of the
water.</p>

<p class='c003'>The best form of rain gauge is
that in use in the Meteorological
Office.</p>

<p>48.<br />Howard’s Rain Gauge.<br />Scale about 1/5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Howard’s Rain Gauge consists
of a vertical glass receiver, or
bottle, through the neck of which
the long terminal tube of a circular
funnel, five inches in diameter,
is inserted. A metal collar
or tube fits over the outside of the
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>neck of the receiver, and aids in keeping the funnel level,
while the tube extends to within half an inch of the
bottom, thus ensuring the retention of every drop of rain
which falls within the area of the funnel. The glass
vessel furnished with the instrument is graduated to
100ths of an inch. A modification of this instrument is
made with a glass tube at the side graduated to inches,
10ths, and 100ths, showing the amount of rainfall by
direct observation, thus dispensing with the use of a
supplementary graduated measure.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Glashier’s Rain Gauge special provision is made,
in two ways, to prevent possible loss by evaporation,
even in the warmest months of the year. 1. The receiving
vessel is partly sunk beneath the soil, thus
keeping the contents cool. 2. The receiving surface
of the funnel, accurately turned to a diameter of eight
inches, terminates at its lower extremity in a curved
tube, which, by always retaining the last few drops of
rain, prevents evaporation. The graduated vessel, in
this instance also, is divided to 100ths of an inch,
having due regard to the larger area, 8 in. of the funnel.
For use in tropical climates, where, as has been shown,
the rainfall is excessive, a modification of this instrument
is supplied by the instrument makers, having an
extra large receiver and tap for drawing off the collected
rain.</p>

<p class='c003'>Luke Howard, in his “Climate of London,” says: “It
must be a subject of great satisfaction and confidence to
the husbandman to know at the beginning of a summer,
by the certain evidence of meteorological results on record,
that the season, in the ordinary course of things,
may be expected to be a dry and warm one, or to find, in
a certain period of it, that the average quantity of rain to
be expected for the month has fallen. On the other hand,
when there is reason, from the same source of information,
to expect much rain, the man who has courage to
begin his operations under an unfavourable sky, but with
good ground to conclude, from the state of his instruments
and his collateral knowledge, that a fair interval is
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>approaching, may often be
profiting by his observations,
while his cautious neighbour,
who ‘waited for the weather
to settle,’ may find that he has
let the opportunity go by.”
This superiority, however, is
attainable by a very moderate
share of application to the
subject, and by the keeping of
a plain diary of the barometer
and rain gauge, with the hygrometer
and vane under his
daily notice.</p>

<p class='c003'>Symons’s Rain Gauge resembles
Howard’s,
but has
the advantage
of having
the glass receiver enclosed in a
black or white japanned metal or
copper jacket with openings permitting
an approximate observation
of the collected rain. The
metal jacket is also furnished with
strong iron spikes, which are firmly
pressed into the soil, as shown at
Fig. 49, thus ensuring perfect
steadiness by its power to resist
the wind. The graduated measure
contains half an inch of rain (for a
5 inch circle) divided into 100ths.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mr. Symons has devised another

a character that it needs
only to become generally known
among amateur meteorologists to

means an observer at a distant

Fig. 50, where the usual 5-inch funnel surmounts a long
glass tube attached to a black board bearing a very open
scale marking tenths of an inch in <i>white</i> lines; a white
float inside the tube constitutes the index, which rises
as the rain increases in quantity. If, as sometimes
happens during a thunderstorm, the rainfall is excessive,
a second tube on the left permits the measurement
of a second inch of rain. It will be obvious that if the
<i>time</i> at which the rain begins to fall be noted the <i>rate</i> at
which it falls, as well as the quantity, is indicated at
sight by this instrument.</p>

<p class='c003'>Crossley’s Registering Rain Gauge has a receiving
surface of 100 square inches. The rain falling
within this area passes through a tube to a vibrating
bucket, which sets in motion a train of wheels,
and these move the indices on three dials, recording
the amount of rain in inches, 10ths, and 100ths.
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>Printed directions are furnished with each instrument,
and the simplicity of the mechanism ensures due
accuracy. A test measure, holding exactly five cubic
inches of water, sent with each gauge, affords the means
of checking its readings from time to time.</p>

<p class='c003'>Beckley’s Pluviograph possesses the exceptional merit
of recording with equal precision all rainfalls, from a
slight summer shower to a heavy storm of rain. It may be
placed in a hole in the ground, with the receiving surface
raised the standard height of ten inches above its level.</p>

<p class='c003'>The funnel has a receiving surface of 100 square inches,
protected by a lip 1-1/4 inch deep, to retain the splashes.
The rain flows into a copper receiving vessel on the right,
which, floating in a cistern of mercury, sinks and draws
down with it a pencil, which records the event on a
white porcelain cylinder moved by a clock. When the
receiving vessel is full the syphon comes into action,
rapidly drawing off <i>the whole</i> of the water, the vessel
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>rising almost at a bound, the action being recorded by a
vertical line on the porcelain cylinder. Two or more
cylinders are supplied with each instrument; and, as
the pencil marks are readily removed by a little soap
and water, a clean one may be always kept at hand for
exchange once in every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Rev. E. Stutter’s Self-recording Rain Gauge
is ingenious, and for a self-recording instrument is very
moderate in price, while it efficiently shows the rainfall
for every hour in the twenty-four (Figs. 52, 53).</p>

<p class='c003'>An eight-day clock with its upright spindle revolves
a small funnel with a sloping tube, the end of which
passes successively over the mouth of the twelve or
twenty-four compartments in the rim of the instrument;
beneath each compartment is placed a tube, as shown in
the sectional figure. All rain received by the outer
funnel drips into the smaller revolving funnel, and flows
down the sloping tube, the end of which is timed to
take an hour in passing over each compartment, so that
the rain, for example, which falls between twelve and one
o’clock will be found in the tube marked 1. Each tube
can contain half an inch of rain, and any overflow falls
into a vessel beneath, and can be measured; the tube
which has overflown shows the hour.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>V.—MOTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Wind is air in motion. The motion of the air is
caused by inequality of temperature. The earth becomes
warmed by the sun, and radiates the heat thus
acquired back upon the air, which, expanding and
becoming lighter, ascends to higher regions, while colder
and denser currents rush in to occupy the vacated space.
Two points are to be noted in connection with this rush
of air which we call wind, viz., its <i>direction</i> and <i>velocity</i>
or <i>force</i>. Both are estimated scientifically by instruments
called Anemometers,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> while mariners and the
dwellers on our coasts have a nomenclature of their own
by which to indicate variation in the <i>force</i> of the wind,
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>founded on the amount of sail a vessel can carry with
safety at the time. In the matter of <i>direction</i> winds are
classed as constant, periodical, and variable.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Constant Winds.</span>—<i>The Trade Winds.</i>—The violent
contrast between the temperature of the equator and
the poles is well known, and from the vast area included
within the tropics ascending currents of rarefied air are
incessantly rising and being as incessantly replaced by a
rush of cold air from the poles to the equator. Were
the earth stationary, this interchange would be of the
simplest kind; on arriving within the influence of the
ascending equatorial current the air from the poles would
be carried to the higher regions and turning over would
proceed to the poles, and, becoming cold and dense in
traversing the higher stratum, would descend and resume
its course <i>ad infinitum</i>. The revolution of the earth on
its axis changes all this: the first effect is that the air at
the equator is borne along with the earth at the rate of
seventeen miles a minute from west to east, a rate which
diminishes at 60° of latitude to one-half that velocity,
until at the poles it is nothing; consequently a <i>slow</i>
north wind flowing to the equator is continually passing
over places possessing a higher velocity than itself, and
not immediately acquiring that velocity, there is according
to the law of the composition of forces a compromise
effected resulting in a north-east wind. In a
similar manner the same process in the southern hemisphere
results in a south-east wind. These winds have
acquired the name of <i>Trade Winds</i> on account of the
facilities afforded to navigation by their constancy.
The <i>North Trades</i> occur in the Atlantic between 9° and
30° and in the Pacific between 9° and 26°. The <i>South
Trades</i> occur in the Atlantic between lat. 4° N. and 22°
S. and in the Pacific between latitude 4° N. and 23-1/2° S.
These limits extend northward with the sun from January
to June, and southward from July to December.</p>

<p class='c003'>Parallel to the equator and extending between 2° and 3°
on each side is a broad belt, where the north and south
trades neutralize each other, producing what is called
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>the “<i>Region or Belt of Calms</i>.” Though wind is absent,
thunderstorms and heavy rains are of daily occurrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Humboldt ascended Teneriffe the trade wind was
blowing at its base in the usual direction, but on arriving
at the summit he found a strong wind blowing in the
opposite direction. Observation has shown that this
upper current prevails north and south of the equator,
and that, after passing the limit of the trade winds, it
descends to form the south-<i>west</i> winds of the north temperate
zone and the north-<i>west</i> winds of the south temperate
zone; the <i>westing</i> being due to the same cause as
the <i>easting</i> in the regular trades, viz., the rotation of
the earth on its axis. These winds are called the Return
Trades, but are not equal in constancy to the regular
trade winds.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Periodical Winds.</span>—<i>Land and Sea Breezes</i> occur on
the coasts, chiefly in tropical countries, but sometimes in
Great Britain during the summer months when the land
during the day becomes very hot, causing an ascending
column of air, which is replaced by a comparatively
colder stream flowing inwards from the sea. At sunset
the conditions are reversed, the earth becomes rapidly
cooled by radiation, the sea continuing comparatively
warm, the air over it ascends, and its place is supplied
by a cold breeze, which “blows off the shore,” as illustrated
by the diagrams and the following experiment—In
the centre of a large tub of water float a water
plate containing hot water, imagine the former to be
the ocean and the latter the heated land, rarefying the
air over it. Light a candle and blow it out and hold it
while still smoking over the cold water, when the smoke
will be seen to move towards the plate. The reverse
of this takes place if the tub be filled with hot water
and the water plate with cold. When this phenomenon
takes place on a large scale, as in the case of the north
trade winds being drawn from their course by the
heated shores of Southern Asia, the gigantic sea breeze
thus produced is called the south-west monsoon. This
occurs from April to October, when the sun is north
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>of the equator. When the sun is south of the equator—that
is, from October to April—the analogue of the land
breeze is produced, and is called the north-east monsoon.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='sc'>Variable Winds.</span>—The character of this class of
winds is determined by the physical configuration of
the country in which they occur. Some tracts are
marked by luxuriant vegetation, others are bare. Here
mountains lift their awful fronts and “midway leave
the storm,” there an arid plain extends itself to the seashore,
or inland, towards a chain of lakes. Within the
tropics these purely local conditions are insufficient to
overcome the force of the prevalent atmospheric currents:
such, however, is not the case beyond the tropical
zone. There the variable winds prevail, for which space
permits only the mention of their names:—The <i>Simoom</i>
(from the Arabic <i>samma</i>, hot), peculiar to the hot
sandy deserts of Africa and Western Asia. The <i>Sirocco</i>
blows over the two Sicilies as a hot wind from the
south. It extends sometimes to the shores of the
Black and Caspian seas, spreading death among animals
and plants. The <i>Solano</i> prevails at certain seasons in
the south of Spain: its direction is south-east. The
<i>Harmattan</i> is another wind of the same class, peculiar
to Senegambia and Guinea. The <i>Puna Winds</i> blow
for four months over a barren tableland called the Puna,
in Peru. They are a portion of the south-east trade winds,
which, having crossed the Pampas, are thereby deprived
of moisture, and become the most parching wind in the
world. The <i>East Winds</i>, peculiar to the spring in Britain,
blowing as they do through Russia, over Europe, are a
portion of the great polar current, distinctive of that season
of the year. They are dry and parching, every one being
familiar with the unpleasant bodily sensations attendant
on this much-abused and yet most beneficent wind.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <i>Etesian Winds</i> are drawn from the north across the
Mediterranean by the great heat of the African desert.
The <i>Mistral</i> is a strong north-west wind peculiar to the
south-east of France. The <i>Pampero</i> is a north-west wind,
blowing in summer from the Pampas of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>As long ago as the year 1600 Lord Bacon remarked
that the preponderating tendency of the wind was decidedly
to veer <i>with</i> the sun’s motion, thus passing from
N. through N.E., E., S.E., to south, thence through
S.W., W.N.W., to N.; also, that it often makes a
complete circuit in that direction, or more than
one in succession (occupying sometimes many days in
so doing), but that it rarely backs, and very rarely or
never makes a complete circuit in the contrary direction.
The merit of having first demonstrated that this tendency
is a direct consequence of the earth’s rotation is
due to Professor Dove, of Berlin, who has also shown
that the three systems of atmospheric currents just
treated of, viz., the constant, periodical, and variable
winds, are all amenable to the same influence.</p>

<p class='c003'>As to the <i>mode</i> of observing the wind, Admiral Fitzroy
recommends that a true east and west line should be
marked <i>about the time of the equinox</i>, and the north,
south, and other points of the compass being added, to
take the bearings of the wind in relation to a dial
so prepared, the indications of the <i>lower</i> stratum of
clouds in conjunction with vanes and smoke being preferred
to any other.</p>

<p class='c003'>The direction of the wind should always be given
according to <i>true</i>, and not to <i>compass bearings</i>. Two
points to the westward nearly represents the amount of
“Variation of the Compass” for the British Isles, which
yields the following table for the conversion of directions
observed by the compass in Great Britain and
Ireland to approximate true bearings.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>“One may call a very simple diagram, a circle divided by a
diameter from north-east to south-west, the <i>thermometer compass</i>.
While the wind is shifting from south-west, by west, north-west, and
<i>north to north-east</i>, the thermometer is falling, but while shifting from
north-east, by east, south-east and south, towards <i>south and south-west</i>,
the thermometer is rising. Now the barometric column does just the
reverse. From north-east the barometer falls as the wind shifts
through the east to south-east, south, and south-west, and from
the south-west, as the wind shifts round northward to north-east,
the barometer rises—it rises to west, north-west, north, and north-east.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The effect of the wind thus shifting round when traced upon paper
by a curve, seems certainly wave-like to the eye; but I believe it to
be simply consequent on the wind shifting round the compass, and
indicating alteration in the barometric column.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If the wind remained north-east, say three weeks, there would be
no wave at all—there would be almost a straight line along a diagram
(varying only a little for <i>strength</i>). The atmospheric line, in such a
case, remains at the same height, and the barometer remains at 30
inches and (say) some three or four-tenths, for weeks together. So
likewise when the wind is south-westerly a long time, or near that
point, the atmospheric line remains <i>low</i>, towards 29 inches. Thus,
such ‘atmospheric waves’ may be an optical delusion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The diagram alluded to above shows how the barometer and
thermometer may be used in connection with each other in foretelling
wind, and consequently weather, that is coming on, because <i>as the one
rises, the other</i> generally <i>falls</i>, and if you take the two together and
confront with their indications the amount of moisture in the air at
any time, you will scarcely be mistaken in knowing what kind
of weather you are likely to have for the <i>next two or three days</i>,
which for the gardener, the farmer, soldier, sailor, and traveller
must be frequently of considerable importance.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>We are indebted to M. Buys Ballot, a Dutch meteorologist,
for an invaluable generalization, the importance
of which it is almost impossible to over-estimate. This
distinguished <i>savant</i> says:—“It is a fact above all
doubt that the wind that comes is nearly at right
angles to the line between the places of highest and
lowest barometer readings. The wind has the place of
lowest barometer at its left hand, and is stronger in
proportion as the difference of barometer readings is
greater.” These facts have been variously stated by
other writers; for example: “Stand with your back to
the wind, and the barometer will be lower on your left
hand than on your right;” “Facing the wind the centre
of depression bears in the right-hand direction,” statements
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>which can be verified at any time by a brief
study of the “Weather Charts” now published in the
daily journals. The value of the law consists in its
connecting the surface winds of our planet with the
actual pressure of the air itself, and it admits of the
following tabulation:—</p>

<p class='c003'>The above are deductions from Buys Ballot’s Law,
still further impressed on the memory by taking four
outline maps of the British Isles, inserting the names of
Thurso, Penzance, Yarmouth, and Valentia, with barometer
readings of the kind above named at each place,
and then drawing a large arrow in red ink across the
centre of each map in the direction appropriate to the
readings.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mr. Strachan, in his able pamphlet on “Weather
Forecasts,” puts the matter thus: “It follows from
Ballot’s Law that in the northern temperate zone the
winds will circulate around an area of low atmospherical
pressure in the <i>reverse direction</i> to the movement of the
hands of a watch, and that the air will flow away from
a region of high pressure, and cause an apparent circulation
of the winds around it, <i>in the direction</i> of watch
hands.” And as the result of a careful digest of data
contained in the eleventh number of meteorological
papers, published by the Board of Trade, he has
established the following valuable propositions. As
introductory to the propositions, it should be stated that
the positions of observations were the following:—</p>

<p class='c003'>“The probable strength of wind will be in proportion
to the rate of increase of statical force, or differences of
barometrical readings. The position of least pressure
must be carefully considered; as, in accordance with the
law, the wind will blow around that locality. The
same remark applies to areas of high pressure, which,
however, very rarely occur in a well-defined manner
over the British Isles.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Referring to the table on page <a href='#Page_76'>76</a>, the scale 0 to 6

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c003'>Few meteorological axioms are better established
than that which embodies the fact that “every wind
brings its weather,” and the primary cause of wind being
the motion of the air induced by rarefaction, it is obvious
that there is a constant tendency for the equatorial
and polar currents in any locality to establish an
equilibrium, and this consideration is found to facilitate
weather predictions for extended periods. Thus, in
consequence of the unusual prevalence of <i>east</i> winds in
the spring of 1862, a wet summer was predicted. The
prediction was fully borne out by an incessant continuance
of <i>south-west winds</i>, with clouded skies and
the usual accompaniment of deluges of rain. These
winds continuing, with slight intermissions only, till the
spring of the following year, less than the usual number
of south-west winds was looked for during the
summer; the result fully justified the anticipation, the
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>summer of 1863 being fine and warm, especially during
the earlier portion. Similarly, without committing the
inaccuracies of Murphy in 1838, the summer of 1877
may be reasonably expected to be a dry and cool one
from the long continuance of warm and wet months in
the winter of 1876-7.</p>

<p class='c003'>The scientific research and mechanical ingenuity
directed of late years to producing trustworthy estimates
of the direction, pressure, and velocity of the wind, have
resulted in the production of a series of instruments,
possessing great precision and accuracy.</p>

<p class='c003'>The <i>direction</i> of the wind is indicated by vanes, a
very efficient form of which is shown at Fig. 54, the

the known velocity.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Pendulum Anemometer
(Fig. 56) shows in a simple
manner the direction and pressure
of the wind. The peculiarly
shaped vane ensures the surface
of the swinging pressure
plate B being always kept
towards the wind. The pendulum
plate hangs, during a
calm, quite vertically, indicating zero,
and as the pressure increases it will
be raised through all degrees of elevation
from 1 to 12. The vane is
perforated with holes large enough
to be visible at some distance from
the ground, the 5 and 10 being
specially larger, so that the angle to
which the pressure plate is raised can
be quickly noted.</p>

<p>57.<br />Lind’s Anemometer. Scale about 1/5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Lind’s Anemometer
or Wind Gauge ranks
among the earliest
forms of instruments
designed to estimate
the force of the
wind. It consists of
a glass syphon, the
limbs of which are
parallel to each
other, mounted on
a vertical rod, on
which it freely oscillates
by the action
of the vane
which surmounts
it. The upper end
of one limb of the
syphon is bent outward
at right angles
to the main direction,
and the action
of the vane keeps
this open end of
the tube always
towards the quarter
from whence
the wind blows.
Between the limbs
of the syphon is
placed a scale
graduated from 0
to 3 in inches and 10ths, the zero being in the centre
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>of the scale. When the instrument is used, it is only
necessary to fill the tube with water to the zero
of the scale, and then expose it to the wind. The
natural consequence of wind acting on the surface
of the water is to depress it in one limb and raise it in
the other, and the sum of the depression and elevation
is the height of a column of water which the wind
is capable of sustaining at the time of observation.
Sudden gusts of wind are apt to produce a jumping
effect on the water in the tube, and to diminish this
the bend of the syphon is contracted. A brass plate is
attached to the foot of the instrument, bearing the
letters indicating the cardinal points of the compass, to
show the direction of the wind.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dr. Robinson, of Armagh, introduced an instrument,
in 1850, which consists of four hemispherical copper
cups attached to the arms of a metal cross. The vertical
axis upon which these are secured has at its lower
extremity an endless screw placed in gear with a train
of wheels and pinions. Each wheel is graduated respectively
to 1/10th, 1 mile, 10 miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles,
and these revolve behind a fixed index, the readings of
which are taken according to the indications on the
dials.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dr. Robinson entertained the theory that the cups
(measuring from their centres) revolved with one-third
of the wind’s velocity; and this theory having been
fully supported by experiment, due allowance has been
made in graduating the wheels so that the true velocity
is obtained by direct observation.</p>

<p class='c003'>In an improved form of this anemometer the hemispherical
cups are retained, but the index portion of the
instrument consists of two graduated concentric circles,
the inner one representing five miles divided into 10ths,
and the outer one bearing 100 divisions, each of which
is equivalent to five miles. At the top of the dial is a
fixed index, which, as the toothed wheel revolves,
marks on the inner circle the miles (up to five) and
10ths of miles the wind has travelled, while a movable
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>index, which revolves with the wheel, indicates on the
outer circle the passage of every five miles.</p>

<div class='ic054'>
<p>58.<br />Improved Anemometer. Scale about 1/5.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>This instrument can be made very portable by removing
the arms bearing the cups, when the whole may
be packed with iron shaft in a case 15 × 13 × 4 inches.
It may be placed in any desired position by screwing the
iron shaft supplied with it into the hole provided for the
purpose, and fixing the apparatus on a pole or on an
elevated stand, if possible, in an open space exposed to
the <i>direct</i> action of the wind.</p>

<p class='c003'>If, when placing the instrument, the hands stand at
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>0, the next reading will, of course, show the number
of miles the wind has traversed; but, should they
stand otherwise, the reading may be noted and deducted
from the second reading, thus: Suppose the fixed index
points to 2·5 and the movable index to 125, the reading
after 12 hours may be 200 on the outer circle and 3·0 on
the inner circle: these added together yield 203. By
deducting the previous reading 127·5, we have the true
reading—viz., 75·5 miles as the distance travelled by the
wind.</p>

<p class='c003'>Having obtained the velocity of the wind in this
manner in miles per hour, the table on page <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>, from
Col. Sir Henry James’s “Instructions for Taking
Meteorological Observations,” will enable the observer
to calculate the pressure in pounds per square foot.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>VI.—ELECTRIFICATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>William Gilbert, a physician of Colchester, first showed
in 1600 that the earth as a whole has the properties of
a magnet, and consequently that the directive action
exerted by it upon a compass needle represents only a
special case of the mutual action of two magnets. In
1845, Faraday established the fact that susceptibility to
magnetic force is not, as was generally believed, confined
to iron, nickel, and a few other substances, but is a
property of all substances. According to Balfour
Stewart, auroræ and earth currents may be regarded
as secondary currents resulting from changes in the
earth’s magnetism. Magnetic phenomena are included
under the general term terrestrial magnetic elements,
and consist of magnetic declination, inclination, and
intensity.</p>

<p class='c003'>These are for convenience determined separately; the
first by an instrument called a <i>Declinometer</i>, and the
second by an <i>Inclinometer</i> or <i>Dipping Needle</i>. The Declinometer
is also made to serve the additional purpose of
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>measuring the <i>intensity</i> of the earth’s magnetic force,
which it effects on a principle similar to that by which
the force of gravity is determined by the oscillations of
a pendulum of known length on any given portion of
the earth’s surface. The declinometer needle is made
to oscillate, and the number of oscillations in a given
time counted; due allowance being made for the strength
of the needle, it is obvious that the force which restores
the needle to rest can be estimated. To ascertain the
angle of <i>declination</i>, the zero line of the compass card
is made to coincide with the geographical north and
south line; and the angle which the direction of the
needle makes with this line is then read off on a graduated
circle over which the needle turns. The magnetic
<i>inclination</i> or <i>dip of the needle</i> is estimated by observing
the inclination to a horizontal plane of a needle turning
on the vertical plane which passes through the magnetic
north and south points.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Fig. 62 shows a simple form of
magnetic needle suspended on a
fine steel point, which is supported
by a brass stand; the addition of a
graduated circle would constitute
such an arrangement a Declinometer.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Fig. 63 gives the appearance of the
dipping needle, or Inclinometer, and Fig. 64 an arrangement
by which
both kinds of
terrestrial as well
as local attraction
may be
shown.</p>

<p class='c003'>These components
of the earth’s magnetism undergo not only an
annual but a daily and even hourly variation, apparently
connected in some occult manner with the
frequency of the sun’s spots. The needle sometimes
suffers such exceptional perturbations as to suggest the
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>idea of a magnetic storm. These disturbances are usually
accompanied (in polar regions) by luminous phenomena
called auroræ. Continuous automatic records of them,
therefore, is of great value, as facilitating inductive research
which may lead to valuable practical results.</p>

<p class='c003'>Accordingly the Royal Society have adopted for the
Kew and other observatories the form of Magnetograph,
or Self-recording Magnetometer, shown at Fig. 61, by
means of which the variations just referred to are registered
by the oscillations of three magnets on photographically
prepared paper, stretched on a drum revolved
by clockwork.</p>

<p class='c003'>One magnet is suspended in the magnetic meridian
by a silk thread, and, by the aid of a mirror attached,
it describes on the cylinder, moved by clockwork in the
centre pier, all the variations in the magnetic <i>declination</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>The other two components of the magnetic force of the
earth are given by the other magnets. That recording
the vertical variations rests on two agate edges under a
glass shade, while the horizontal component magnet is
suspended by a double silk thread, under the shade to
the right of the picture, being retained by the tension
of the thread in a position nearly at right angles to the
magnetic meridian.</p>

<p class='c003'>The clock box in the centre covers the three revolving
cylinders bearing the sensitive photographic paper, and
to each magnet is attached a semicircular mirror, which
reflects the rays from a gas jet to one of the cylinders,
and thus describes by a curved line the oscillations of
the magnet. A second semicircular mirror is <i>fixed</i> to
the pier on which the instrument stands, and consequently
describes a straight line, or zero, from whence
the curves are measured.</p>

<p class='c003'>To avoid errors attending sudden changes of temperature,
underground vaults are always chosen for magnetic
observations, and also on account of light being more
easily and perfectly excluded.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Since the performance of Franklin’s famous kite
experiment, by which he determined the identity of
lightning with the electrical discharge from a machine,
much attention has been devoted, not only to that form
of atmospheric electricity which displays itself in the
thunder-cloud, but to the electric condition of the air in
all states of the weather. These researches have established
the fact that the air is always in
an electrical condition, even when the
sky is clear and free from thunder-clouds.
The instruments employed
for ascertaining the kind and intensity
of atmospheric electricity are
called Electroscopes. Fig. 65 shows
a modification of Saussure’s Electroscope,
the basis of which is a narrow-mouthed
flint glass bottle with a
divided scale to indicate the degree
of divergence of the gold leaves or
straws. To protect the lower part
from rain, it is covered by a metallic
shield about five inches in
diameter. Bohnenberger’s Electroscope
indicates the presence and
quality of <i>feeble</i> electric currents.
Peltier’s Electrometer yields the
same result by the deflection of
a magnetic needle. This latter has
been in use at Brussels for thirty
years, and at Utrecht for twenty
years, and is highly recommended.</p>

<p>65.<br />Electroscope.<br />Scale about 1/7.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Singer’s Atmospheric Electroscope
is an efficient form of the instrument
in which an ordinary gold-leaf electrometer
has attached to its circular
brass plate a brass rod two feet in
length, with a clip at its upper extremity
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>to receive a lighted paper or cigar fusee. The
electricity of the air in immediate contact with the flame,
causes, by induction, electricity of the opposite nature
to accumulate at the upper extremity, where it is
constantly carried off by the convection currents in the
flame, leaving the conductor charged with the same
kind and power of electricity as that contained in the
air at the time of the experiment. The principle of
this method was initiated by Volta, and has been
extended and applied by Sir William Thomson in his
Water-dropping Collector, which consists of an insulated
cistern from which water escapes through a jet so fine
that it breaks into drops immediately after leaving the
nozzle of the tube. The result of this is that in half a
minute from the starting of the stream the can is found
to be electrified to the same extent as the air at the
point of the tube. The scale value of
each instrument has to be separately
determined by repeated comparative experiments,
and involves much delicacy of
manipulation.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is chiefly important for the ordinary
observer to know that the occurrence of
thunder and lightning should be always
noted in the column headed “Remarks.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id062'>

<div class='ic062'>
<p>66.<br />Lightning<br />Conductor.<br />Scale about 1/10.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The destructive effects of lightning
are too well known to need description
here; the means, however, by which these
may be averted demand a brief notice.
Lightning when discharged from a cloud
will always choose the better of any
two conductors which may present themselves.
The <i>stone</i> of a church steeple and
the <i>wood</i> of a ship’s mast are bad conductors,
but a galvanized iron wire rope
is the best possible conductor, and accordingly
this material is now generally
employed for the purpose. A lightning
conductor consists of three parts: 1, the
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>rod, which extends beyond the summit of the building,
2, the conductor, which connects the rod with the
underground portion, and 3, the part underground.
The connection between each of these must be absolutely
perfect, or the conductor will be faulty. The
top is usually of solid copper tipped with platinum (Fig.
66), the body of galvanized iron rope, so as to adapt itself
to the inequalities of the building and yet have no
sharp turns in it, while the part underground is of
solid iron rod. This latter portion should extend
straight underground for two feet, and being bent at
right angles away from the wall, should rest in a
horizontal drain 10 to 15 feet long filled with charcoal,
and be again bent downwards into a well of water.
Should water not be available, it should rest in the
centre of a hole 15 feet deep and 10 inches in diameter,
tightly packed with charcoal, which, while conducting
the electricity from the rod into the earth, serves also to
preserve the iron from rusting.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>OZONE.</h3>

<p class='c003'>The atmosphere, besides holding the vapour of water
diffused throughout its mass, contains also minute traces
of carbonic acid and ammonia, and a very remarkable
substance called Ozone. Oxygen, one of the component
gases of the atmosphere, is capable of existing in two
conditions; one in which it is comparatively passive, and
another in which it possesses exceptional chemical
activity, dependent apparently upon its electrical condition,
and in which state it possesses a peculiar smell
which has caused it to be named ozone.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The characteristic
odour is always observable near a powerful electric
machine when it is being worked, near a battery
used for the decomposition of water, and in the air after
the passage of a flash of lightning. Its presence is most
marked near the sea-coast, and in localities remarkable
for their salubrity; and on account of its influence on
health, it has been proposed by Schonbein and others
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>to include ozonometrical observations with the ordinary
meteorological observations.</p>
<hr class='c014' />
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Greek <i>ozo</i>, I smell.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c003'>Although in minute quantities it is favourable to
health, when existing in undue proportion it irritates
the mucous membrane of the nose and throat, producing
painful sores. It attacks india-rubber, bleaches indigo,
and oxidizes silver and mercury, differing in all these
points from ordinary atmospheric oxygen.</p>

<p class='c003'>The chemical energy it possesses (which exceeds that
of ordinary oxygen as much as the latter exceeds
atmospheric air as an oxidizing agent) affords the means
of ascertaining its presence and quantity. It liberates
iodine from its combination with potassium, and free
iodine colours starch a deep blue.</p>

<p class='c003'>Schonbein, the discoverer of ozone, found that when
strips of paper previously saturated with starch and
iodide of potassium and dried were exposed freely to
the air but protected from rain and the direct action of
the sun, they underwent a peculiar discoloration (when
immersed in water) after an exposure of 24 hours. A
scale of tints numbered from one to ten afforded the
means of comparative observation, and thus the Ozonometer
was constructed, and a means established of
registering the amount of ozone in the air of various
localities from day to day.</p>

<p class='c003'>Schonbein also observed that
the proportion of ozone was
largely augmented after heavy
falls of snow. For the exposure
of the ozone papers, an ozone
cage is employed, as shown at
Fig. 67.</p>

<div class='ic063'>
<p>67.<br />Ozone Cage.<br />Scale about 1/6.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Ozone may be prepared artificially
as a disinfectant by cautiously
mixing without friction
or concussion equal parts of
peroxide of manganese, permanganate
of potash, and oxalic
acid. For a room containing 1,000 cubic feet, two teaspoonfuls
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>of the powder, placed in a dish and moistened
with water occasionally, will develop the ozone and
disinfect the surrounding air without producing cough.</p>

<p class='c003'>The most important and interesting series of facts,
however, connected with ozone are those established by
the researches of M. Houzeau, who states:—</p>

<p class='c026'>1. That country air contains an odorous oxidizing
substance, with the power of bleaching blue
litmus, without previously reddening it, of
destroying bad smells, and of bluing iodized
red litmus.</p>

<p class='c026'>2. That this substance is ozone.</p>

<p class='c026'>3. That the amount of ozone in the air at different
times and places is variable, but this is at
most 1/700,000 of its volume, or 1 volume of ozone
in 700,000 of air.</p>

<p class='c026'>4. That ozone is found much more frequently in
the country than in towns.</p>

<p class='c026'>5. That ozone is in greatest quantity in spring,
less in summer, diminishes in autumn, and is
least in winter.</p>

<p class='c026'>6. It is most frequently detected on rainy days,
and during great atmospheric disturbances.</p>

<p class='c026'>7. That atmospheric electricity is apparently the
great generator of ozone.</p>

<p class='c003'>The subject is one of great interest in its bearings
on health, and opens a wide field of scientific research,
as may be inferred from the opinion expressed by the
Vienna Congress, which is that “the existing methods
of determining the amount of ozone in the atmosphere
are insufficient, and the Congress therefore recommends
investigations for the discovery of better methods.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mr. Lowe has published the valuable weather
warnings tabulated on page <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>, which are interesting

<p class='c003'>Among the animals whose movements give weather
warnings few are more trustworthy than the leech.
The reader may verify this by placing one in a broad
glass bottle, tied over with perforated leather, or
bladder. If placed in a northern aspect, the leech will
be found to behave in the following manner:—</p>

<p class='c003'>1. On the approach of fine or frosty weather, according
to the season, it will be found curled up at the
bottom. 2. On the approach of rain, snow, or wind, it
will rise excitedly to the surface. 3. Thunder will
cause it to be much agitated, and to leave the water

examination into the chances of a change of weather,
that <i>the weather has a decided tendency to preserve its
character</i>. Thus, at Brussels, if it has rained for nine
or ten days successively, the <i>next</i> day will be wet also
in four cases out of five; and the chance of a change
decreases with the length of time for which the weather
<i>from</i> which the change is to take place has lasted.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the case of temperature for five-day periods, the
same principle holds good;<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> for if a cold five-day period
sets in after warm weather, we can bet two to one that
the next such period will be cold too; but if the cold
has lasted for two months, we can bet nearly eight to
one that the first five days of the next month will be
cold too. The chance of change is, however, greater
for the five-day periods than for single days. Similar
results follow for the months, but here again the chance
of change shows an increase.</p>

<p class='c003'>“If we revert to the instance first cited, that of rain,
the result is, <i>not</i> that if it once begins to rain the
chances are in favour of its never ceasing; all that is
implied is, that the chances are against its ceasing on a
definite day, and that they increase with the length of time
the rain has lasted. The problem is similar to that of
human life: the chance of a baby one year old living
another year is less than that of a man of thirty.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The practical meaning of all this is, that although
we know that a compensating anomaly for all extraordinary
weather exists somewhere on the earth’s surface,
<i>e.g.</i>, the very common case of intense cold in America,
while we have a mild winter in Britain, there is no
reason as yet ascertained to anticipate that this compensation
will occur at any given place during the year.
In other words, when definite conditions of weather
have thoroughly established themselves, it is only with
great difficulty that the courses of the atmospheric
currents are changed.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>To bring within the limits of a popular pamphlet a
notice of the various phenomena classed under the head
of Meteorology, it has been necessary to exercise the
utmost brevity. Brief, however, as the treatment has
been, reference has been made to the sciences of Heat,
Light, Electricity, Magnetism, Gravitation, Astronomy,
Chemistry, Geography, and Geology, thus corroborating
the testimony of Sir John Herschel, who states that “it
can hardly be impressed forcibly enough on the attention
of the student of nature that there is scarcely any natural
phenomenon which can be fully and completely explained
in all its circumstances without a union of several—perhaps
of all—the sciences; and it cannot be doubted
that whatever walk of science he may determine to
pursue, impossible as it is for a finite capacity to explore
all with any chance of success, he will find it illuminated
in proportion to the light which he is enabled to throw
upon it from surrounding regions. But, independently
of this advantage, the glimpse which may thus be
obtained of the harmony of Creation, of the unity of its
plan, of the theory of the material universe, is one of
the most exalted objects of contemplation which can be
presented to the faculties of a rational being. In such
a general survey he perceives that science is a whole
whose source is lost in infinity, and which nothing but
the imperfection of our nature obliges us to divide.
He feels his nothingness in his attempts to grasp it,
and he bows with humility and adoration before that
Supreme Intelligence who alone can comprehend it, and
who ‘in the beginning saw everything that He had
made, and behold it was very good.’”</p>
